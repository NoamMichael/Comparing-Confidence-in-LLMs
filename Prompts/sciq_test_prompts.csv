        Based on the reasoning above, Provide the best answer and the likelihood that each option is correct from 0.0 to 1.0 in a JSON format. The probabilities should sum to 1.0. For example:

        {
        'A': <Probability choice A is correct. As a float from 0.0 to 1.0>,
        'B': <Probability choice B is correct. As a float from 0.0 to 1.0>,

        'Answer': <Your answer choice here, as a single letter and nothing else.>
        }

        All options have a non-zero probability of being correct. No option should have a probability of 0 or 1.
