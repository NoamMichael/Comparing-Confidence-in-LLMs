The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

}","RealProp owns a class 1 building, the Garza Tower. Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings and must have traded to end up with no class 2 buildings, Trustcorp must have traded a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. This means Trustcorp traded the Meyer Building and must have received two class 3 buildings in return, one of which is the Yates House (class 3). Therefore, RealProp must own the Garza Tower (class 1).
Answer: A) RealProp owns a class 1 building. 

Reasoning: Trustcorp's trade sequence leads to RealProp owning a class 1 building. This deduction is highly certain.",False
