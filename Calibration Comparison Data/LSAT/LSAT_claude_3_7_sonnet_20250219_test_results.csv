Since George must also report on Tuesday, and only two people can report each day, this creates a contradiction. Nina can't report on Tuesday (with George) because then Robert must be on Monday or Wednesday. If Robert reports on Monday, Nina must report on Wednesday which contradicts her being on Tuesday.

Since Olivia and Robert can only give morning reports but all morning slots are filled, neither can present. George can only present on Tuesday. If Nina presents, Helen and Irving must present the next day (unless Nina presents Wednesday).

Question: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.Q: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true? Answer Choices: (A)The optometrist is in space 5.

From the fourth solo condition, either Wayne performs traditional or Zara performs modern in solo 4.

Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.Q: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule? Answer Choices: (A)Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday. (B)Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday. (C)Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday. (D)Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday. (E)Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.

}","Reasoning: If Franco and Hong testify on the same day, it can't be Monday (Hong can't testify Monday). Since Iturbe testifies Wednesday and exactly two witnesses testify Tuesday, we need to analyze the distribution of the five witnesses. If Franco and Hong testify Tuesday, Garcia must testify either Monday or Wednesday. If Franco and Hong testify Wednesday, they'd join Iturbe, making three witnesses on Wednesday. This would leave exactly two witnesses for the other two days combined, which violates the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Franco and Hong must testify Tuesday, meaning Hong testifies Tuesday.

Question: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.Q: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?

}","Reasoning: Given that Tao was second and Peters was fourth, I need to check which option is possible. Stanton can't be adjacent to Tao, so Stanton can't be first or third. Also, Villas was recruited immediately before White, so they must be consecutive. Quinn was earlier than Rovero. Looking at option C: If Stanton is sixth, I can construct a valid ordering. For example: Quinn (1st), Tao (2nd), Rovero (3rd), Peters (4th), Villas (5th), Stanton (6th), White (7th). This works because Stanton isn't adjacent to Tao",False,D,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,C,False

Given Peters was 4th, and Villas was immediately before White, those positions must be adjacent. From the facts: Quinn → Rovero (directly), and Quinn was earlier than Rovero. If Quinn is immediately before Rovero, they must occupy consecutive positions. Since Peters is 4th, and Villas and White are consecutive, there are constraints on possible positions. When I work through the scenarios, Stanton cannot be 5th because the placement of other people (particularly Peters at 4th and the consecutive Quinn/Rovero pair) would create contradictions.",False,B,0.05,0.1,0.05,0.75,0.05,D,False

Since Villas was recruited immediately before White, and White was recruited immediately before Quinn, we have the sequence: Villas → White → Quinn. Since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and we already have Peters at position 4, the Villas-White-Quinn sequence must start no later than position 3.

Since Louise works second shift on two consecutive days, she must work some combination of Monday-Tuesday, Tuesday-Wednesday, Wednesday-Thursday, or Thursday-Friday. Katya is on Tuesday, so Louise must work Tuesday's second shift if she works Tuesday at all. If we test option E, we can construct valid schedules with Louise working on Tuesday.

Grecia's two non-consecutive first shifts can't overlap with Louise's two consecutive second shifts. If Joe works Wednesday with Hakeem, his second day can't violate these patterns.

The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.Q: Which one of the following could be true?

}","Reasoning: From the conditions, I know Isaacs's oil is in the lower position of wall 4 and Greene's watercolor is on the same wall as Franz's oil (which is lower). Also, Franz and Isaacs can't share a wall. If option A were true, Franz's watercolor would be on the same wall as Greene's oil. But since Greene's watercolor is already paired with Franz's oil on another wall, this would mean Greene has both paintings on different walls with Franz's paintings - requiring Franz to have both paintings on walls with Greene, which is impossible since each student has exactly two paintings.

Question: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.

}","Reasoning: Looking at option A, the changes from the initial state are: RealProp loses both class 3 buildings (Yates, Zimmer) and gains nothing. Southco gains two class 3 buildings. This matches trading rule #3: one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. Southco traded its Lynch Building (class 2) for RealProp's Yates House and Zimmer House (both class 3). This is a valid single trade, while the other options would require multiple trades or trades that don't follow the allowed patterns.
