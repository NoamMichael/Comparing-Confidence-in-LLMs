Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.Q: Which one of the following could be the schedule of the students' reports?

Given the premises, George (G) must report on Tuesday. Nina (N) and Robert (R) must report on Monday and Wednesday. If N reports on Monday, then Helen (H) and Irving (I) must report on Tuesday. This is impossible, as G also reports on Tuesday, exceeding the two-slot limit for that day. Therefore, N must report on Wednesday and R on Monday.

Given that Helen, Kyle, and Lenore fill the three morning slots, George must take the Tuesday afternoon slot, as it's the only day he can report. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, and since all morning slots are taken, they cannot report at all. This means the remaining reporters, Irving and Nina, must fill the Monday and Wednesday afternoon slots. If Nina reports on Monday, then Helen and Irving must report on Tuesday. This is impossible, as George already occupies the only available Tuesday slot (afternoon). Thus, Nina cannot report on Monday, which means Irving must.

If P were performed seventh, S would have to be performed in the only remaining slot, which is eighth. However, the eighth slot is reserved for L or H. Since S is a distinct composition from L and H, S cannot be performed eighth. This creates a direct contradiction, meaning P cannot be performed seventh. This deduction is based on a direct conflict between two rules, making it a certainty.

The (TF) or (RT) block must occupy slots 4 and 5. If (RT) occupies slots 4-5, T is 5th, and F must be 7th to maintain the required two-composition gap from R.

Let's assume Day 2 and Day 6 feature the same kitten and puppy breeds.
From the main rules, we deduce that the puppy on Day 7 (P7) must be Newfoundland (N). By the non-consecutive rule, P6 cannot be N.
Also, P1 is Greyhound (G), so P2 cannot be G. Since we assumed P2=P6, P6 also cannot be G.
Therefore, P6 must be a Rottweiler (R). This implies K6 cannot be a Himalayan (H).
K7 is either Manx or Siamese. By the non-consecutive rule, K6 cannot be the same as K7.

For Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, there are no specific rules. It's possible to create valid schedules where these days have zero batches by distributing all 9 batches across the other days.

Since a valid scenario with two or fewer batches can be constructed for each of the five days, all five days qualify.

Question: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.Q: If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT: Answer Choices: (A)Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday. (B)Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday. (C)Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday.

The three ""second"" batches are O2, P2, and S2. With O2 fixed on Tuesday and S2 fixed on Thursday, it is impossible for two different kinds of ""second"" batches to be made on Wednesday.

O2 and P1 are on the same day, which must be after O1's day and before P2's and P3's days. This day cannot be Monday (no day before for O1) or Thursday/Friday (not enough later days for P2/P3). Thus, O2 and P1 must be on Tuesday. For P2 and P3 to follow on separate days, P2 must be on Thursday. Therefore, Thursday must contain at least S2 and P2.

From the rules, Megregian (M) must review more plays than Kramer (K) and Lopez (L), who each review at least one play. This means M must review 2 or 3 plays. If M reviews all 3 plays, Jiang (J) cannot review any (as their plays are disjoint), which is not allowed. Therefore, M must review exactly 2 plays. Consequently, K and L must each review 1 play.

If he did, Megregian couldn't, but Kramer would, forcing Megregian's play count to 3, which would include U—a contradiction.

Question: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.Q: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?

The rules create two distinct ordering chains: R > Y > T and X > S. The rule that Robertson must be in spaces {1, 2, 3, 4}, combined with the R > Y > T chain, means R cannot be #1 or #2, as two lower spots are needed for Y and T. Thus, Robertson must be in #3 or #4. This limits Young to spots {2, 3} and Togowa to spots {1, 2}. Across all possible scenarios, the two highest spots, #5 and #6, are the only ones consistently available for X, who must be higher than S. Therefore, R, Y, T, and X are the four employees each limited to two spaces.

According to the rules, Theresa must test H, so if she doesn't on day one, she must on day two. Simultaneously, the rule states the bike Yuki tests on day one (H) must be tested by Seamus on day two. This would require both Theresa and Seamus to test bicycle H on the second day, which violates the condition that each bicycle is tested by only one rider per day. Therefore, this scenario cannot occur.

Case 1: Seamus tests G on Day 1 (S1=G) and Theresa on Day 2 (T2=G). Since T must test H, she must do so on Day 1 (T1=H). On Day 1, Y cannot test J, so she must test F (Y1=F). Rule 4 then dictates that Seamus must test F on Day 2 (S2=F), which contradicts S testing G on Day 2.
Case 2: Theresa tests G on Day 1 (T1=G) and Seamus on Day 2 (S2=G). Rule 4 states Y1=S2, so Yuki must also test G on Day 1. This is impossible as two riders cannot test the same bike on the same day.

Question: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.Q: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?

This cannot be Thursday (Julio is there) or Friday (Olivia is there), so they must be on Wednesday (W-AM and W-PM). Nessa must be in an afternoon session. With Wednesday and Thursday afternoons taken, Nessa must be in Friday afternoon (F-PM). This forces Olivia into Friday morning (F-AM). The only remaining assistant, Lan, must fill the last slot: Thursday morning (Th-AM). Thus, we can determine the sessions for Olivia, Nessa, and Lan.

The rules state that Parra and Quinn are always in the same zone. The rules also state that either Parra or Tiao, but not both, must be in Zone 1. This creates a direct conflict preventing Parra and Tiao from ever being in the same zone. If they were in Zone 2 or 3, Parra would not be in Zone 1, forcing Tiao into Zone 1—a contradiction. They cannot both be in Zone 1 by rule. Since Parra and Tiao can never share a zone, and Quinn is always with Parra, Quinn and Tiao can never be in the same zone.

From the conditions, S3 is a Traditional piece (T), and there's a consecutive T-T block. This means the piece sequence is either M,T,T,M,M or M,M,T,T,M.
Let's test the M,T,T,M,M sequence.
- S1 must be W-M (Wayne-Modern) so a W-M comes before the first T at S2.
- Let S2 and S3 be Z-T (Zara-Traditional).
- S4 can be Z-M, satisfying the condition that S4 is W-T or Z-M.
- Pianist(S2)=Zara, so Pianist(S5) must be Wayne. S5 is W-M.

Given the fifth solo is traditional (T5) and the third is traditional (T3), the rule that ""exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively"" forces the piece sequence to be Modern-Traditional-Traditional-Modern-Traditional. This is because the consecutive block must be T2-T3, otherwise an invalid T3-T4-T5 sequence would occur. The first solo must be a Modern piece performed by Wayne (WM) to satisfy the rule that a WM precedes any T. The fourth solo must be a Modern piece performed by Zara (ZM) to satisfy the fourth condition. Thus, only solos 1 and 4 are fully determined.

Given that no voicemail target is 3 days, voicemail targets can only be 1 or 2 days. Since Image's voicemail (I_V) must be shorter than Solide's (S_V) and Truvest's (T_V), I_V must be 1, and S_V and T_V must both be 2. Website targets cannot be longer than voicemail targets, so Image's website (I_W) must be 1. Solide's website (S_W) must be shorter than Truvest's (T_W). Since both S_W and T_W must be ≤ 2, the only way for S_W < T_W is if S_W = 1 and T_W = 2. Thus, the statement that Solide's website target is 2 days is false.

From the rules, we know Image's voicemail (IV) must be shorter than Solide's (SV), so IV < SV. The question adds that Solide's voicemail (SV) is shorter than Truvest's website (TW), so SV < TW. This creates the chain IV < SV < TW. Since the only possible values are 1, 2, and 3, this forces IV=1 day, SV=2 days, and TW=3 days. The rules also state Solide's website target (SW) cannot be longer than its voicemail target (SW ≤ SV). Since SV is 2 days, SW can be 1 or 2 days. Therefore, Solide's website target is the only option that could be 2 days.

With G (Finance) in slot 4, several constraints apply. First, G's neighbors (slots 3 and 5) cannot be Finance. The condition `J < G < R` places J before slot 4 and R after. The condition ""S < Q only if Q = 3"" simplifies to `Q < S` because G is 4th. We also have `S < Y`.

(A) is impossible, as G and H are both Finance. (B), (C), and (D) create contradictions, typically violating `S < Y` or forcing two Finance articles to be consecutive. (E) is possible. The sequence Q, J, S, G, R, Y, H satisfies all rules.

This leaves the three Finance articles (J, G, H) to be scheduled among the first four positions, alongside Q.

The J<G rule places J first and G third. Slot 2 must be a non-finance article. Placing Y or S there leads to contradictions with other rules, so Q must be second. The first four are J-Q-G-R.

The rules establish a fixed sequence: Vegemite performs before Zircon (V < Z), and Zircon performs before Xpert (Z < X). This creates a chain, V < Z < X, meaning at least two bands must perform after Vegemite. If Vegemite were in slot five, only slot six would remain. It is impossible to place both Zircon and Xpert in this single remaining slot. Therefore, Vegemite cannot perform in slot five.

Given Vegemite (V) is in slot 3, Yardsign (Y) must be in slot 1 or 2 (rule 5). The rules state Uneasy (U) is in {4,5,6} and Zircon (Z) must be after V, so Z is in {4,5,6}. As Xpert (X) must be after Z, X also goes in {4,5,6}. This means slots 4, 5, and 6 are filled by U, Z, and X. Consequently, the only remaining band, Wellspring (W), must fill whichever of slots 1 or 2 is not taken by Y. Since W is in {1,2} and Z is in {4,5}, W must perform earlier than Z.

Please provide your reasoning first, limited to 100 words, and consider how certain you should be of your answer.
Reasoning: ","The original constraints are: (1) V < Z, (2) W < X, (3) Z < X, (4) U in {4,5,6}, (5) Y in {1,2,3}. The question asks to replace (2) and (3).

From (1) and (3), we deduce V < Z < X. So V must be before X.
From (2), W must be before X.
From (5), Y is in slots 1, 2, or 3. The other rules (V,W,Z < X) force X into slot 4 or later, meaning Y must always be before X.
Therefore, four bands—V, W, Y, and Z—must perform before X. The only remaining band is U. This means only U can possibly perform after X.

Statement (A) perfectly captures this complete deduction. If we substitute (A) for (W<X, Z<X), the resulting system is logically equivalent. (A) is a necessary consequence of the original rules, and it also implies the rules it replaces (W<X and Z<X).

Statement (E) is also a necessary consequence and also implies the rules it replaces. However, (A) describes the fundamental relational cause, while (E) describes the positional effect. (A) is a more direct and comprehensive replacement for the original relational rules.

Since Y must perform in one of the first three slots and X must therefore be in slot 4 or later, Y also always performs before X. This means four bands (V, W, Y, Z) must always precede X. Consequently, only Uneasy (U) can possibly perform in a later slot than Xpert. Statement (A) captures this deduction. Substituting (A) for the original constraint (W<X and Z<X) is equivalent because it explicitly implies W<X and Z<X while being a necessary consequence of all original rules combined.

For the horror and mystery to be on different screens, one must be on Screen 2 and the other on Screen 3. If the western were at 8 PM (Screen 3), then H and M would both be forced onto Screen 2, violating the rule. Therefore, the western must be at 7 PM.

Given that the lecture on terns (T) is in Howard Auditorium (H), and the lecture on sandpipers (S) is also in H, these must be the two H lectures.

The conditions state `T < P` and `S < O`, meaning neither T nor S can be the fifth (last) lecture, eliminating options E and D. The lecture on Petrels (P) must be in Gladwyn Hall (G), so option B is impossible. This leaves A and C. There are three lectures in Gladwyn Hall and two in Howard Auditorium (H). We know `1:G` and `4:H`. If the fifth lecture were in H (as in C), the other H lecture must be at 4. The rule `S(H) < O` would then require `S=4` and `O=5`, making `5:O(H)`, not `R(H)`. Therefore, C is impossible, leaving A as the only possibility.

From the rules, we can establish a required sequence. The percussionist (P) is before the keyboard player (K), so P < K. The violinist (V) is also before the keyboard player, so V < K. The keyboard player is before the guitarist (G), so K < G.

Combining these, we see that V, P, and K must all perform their solos before G. This means at least three performers precede the guitarist. Consequently, the earliest possible solo for the guitarist is the fourth one. Therefore, the guitarist cannot perform the third solo.

Question: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.Q: Which one of the following must be true? Answer Choices: (A)Farley's lecture is earlier than the sculptures lecture. (B)Holden's lecture is earlier than the lithographs lecture. (C)The sculptures lecture is earlier than Garcia's lecture. (D)The sculptures lecture is earlier than Jiang's lecture. (E)The watercolors lecture is earlier than Garcia's lecture.

If the watercolors lecture is third, the lithographs lecture must be fourth, as it must be later. The constraint that Farley's lecture is earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which is earlier than the lithographs lecture (F < O < L), means Farley must be first and oil paintings second.

With two solid rugs, there must be one three-color rug to account for the five colors used. Due to the rules, neither White (W) nor Olive (O) can be a solid color. If the solid rugs were Peach (P) and Yellow (Y), the third rug's colors must be chosen from the remaining set {Forest, Olive, Turquoise, White}.

Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, so they are always required. To determine if Knutson must be assigned, let's assume he is not. If Knutson is unassigned, he is not at Thorne. By the fourth constraint, this forces both Heideck and Mays to be assigned to Thorne. Frost must join them (first constraint). To satisfy the two-photographer minimum at Silva, the only remaining photographers, Gonzalez and Lai, must be assigned there. However, Gonzalez at Silva requires Lai at Thorne (third constraint), which creates a contradiction. Therefore, the initial assumption is false, and Knutson must be assigned.

Reasoning: ","The condition of exactly four photographers assigned requires two at Silva and two at Thorne to meet the minimum. The rule that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together means they form one of these pairs. Let's test if they can be at Thorne (T={F, H}). If so, Knutson is not at Thorne. The last rule then requires both Heideck and Mays to be assigned to Thorne. This would make the Thorne team {F, H, M}, which contradicts the two-person limit. Therefore, Frost and Heideck cannot be at Thorne and must be assigned to Silva.

With exactly four photographers assigned, there must be two at Silva (S) and two at Thorne (T) to meet the minimum requirement. Frost and Heideck (F, H) must be assigned together.

Let's assume F & H are assigned to Thorne. Then T = {F, H}. This means Knutson (K) is not assigned to Thorne. According to the last rule, if K is not at Thorne, then both H and Mays (M) must be assigned there. Since H is at Thorne, this would require M to be assigned there as well. But Thorne is full with {F, H}, creating a contradiction.

Therefore, the assumption is false. F & H cannot be at Thorne and must be assigned to Silva.

Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.Q: If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then which one of the following must be true of the six photographs?

Therefore, Sports must have two F photos. The second rule requires a photographer from Lifestyle (only H) to also have a photo in Metro, so Metro has at least one H. This means H has at least 3 photos. Since no photographer can have more than three, H has exactly 3. With F=2 and H=3, and a total of six photos, Gagnon (G) must have exactly one photo.

Rule 1 states M and P cannot be in the same season, placing P in the spring. This means K, N, and P are all in the spring. The only remaining cookbooks that could be published in the fall along with M are L and O. Therefore, the only possible pair from the choices is L and O.

The rule that 1923 must be Louis (L) or Tiffany (T) means the O-R block cannot be in 1922-23 or 1923-24. Therefore, O must be in 1921 and R in 1922. With Yoshio (Y) also assigned, the remaining students (Y and either L or T) must fill 1923 and 1924. To satisfy the 1923 rule, Y must be in 1924. A possible scenario is O-1921, R-1922, L-1923, Y-1924.

Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.

If either L or T is in 1921, this forces the other into 1923, and requires the Onyx-Ryan pair to be assigned. The remaining years, 1922 and 1924, are not consecutive, so the Onyx-Ryan block cannot be placed. This eliminates L, T, and R.

If Yoshio is not assigned, the four students are from {L, M, O, R, T}.

Kammer must come before Trillo, so Kammer cannot be sixth. Now consider Lugo. If Lugo is sixth, Kammer must be fifth (since slot 5 must be recorded). However, Kammer must be before Trillo, which would force Trillo to be sixth, creating a contradiction. Therefore, by elimination, only Trillo can be the sixth audition. This is valid in a sequence like W, L, Z, Y, K, T.

The question states Kammer (K) is immediately before Yoshida (Y), forming a K-Y block. The 5th audition must be recorded (K or L). K cannot be 5th, because K must come before Trillo (T). Thus, Lugo (L) must be 5th. The rules W < K and Z < Y require both Waite (W) and Zinn (Z) to be scheduled before K. This means K must be at least 3rd. Given L is 5th and the 4th slot isn't recorded, K must be 3rd, making Y 4th. This forces T to be 6th, and W and Z to be 1st and 2nd. Therefore, Zinn's audition could be second.

Y cannot be 5th (A) because slot 5 is recorded. Y cannot be 1st (E) because Z must be earlier. If Y is 2nd or 3rd, the requirements for Z and W create contradictions. However, Y can be 4th.

Reasoning: ","The original rules are: 1) 4th is Not-Recorded (NR), 2) 5th is Recorded (R), 3) Waite (W) is earlier than both recorded auditions (K, L), 4) K is earlier than Trillo (T), 5) Zinn (Z) is earlier than Yoshida (Y).

From these rules, we can deduce the possible positions for W. The recorded auditions are K and L. One R is in slot 5. Due to K<T, the other R cannot be in slot 6. It also cannot be in slot 1, because W must be earlier. Therefore, the R slots must be {2,5} or {3,5}. For W to be earlier than both R auditions, W must be in slot 1 (if R is in 2) or in slot 1 or 2 (if R is in 3). In all valid scenarios, W must be in either slot 1 or 2. Option (D) states this necessary consequence. While necessary consequences are not always sufficient replacements, in this context, it is the most direct and powerful outcome derived from the original condition, making it the best substitute.

}","Reasoning: The original conditions are that one recorded audition (R) is in slot 5, and Waite (W) must be earlier than both recorded auditions (K and L). Also, K must be earlier than T (NR). The combination of K<T and 5=R forces the other recorded audition out of slot 6, as K would have to be in slot 5 or 6, leaving no valid later slot for the non-recorded T. This forces the R slots to be {2,5} or {3,5}. If R slots are {2,5}, W must be 1. If R slots are {3,5}, W must be 1 or 2. Therefore, a necessary consequence is that W must be first or second.

Placing X in chapter 4 is impossible, as it prevents a valid placement of the T _ _ W block without violating other rules. Therefore, X must be in chapter 2. This configuration forces T into chapter 4 and W into chapter 7. The remaining clues (R, S, Z) must fill the remaining chapters (1, 5, 6).

Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.Q: If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, which one of the following could be true?

The adjacent UX/XU block must be XU in chapters 3-4, so U cannot be in 1. However, if T is in 3 and W is in 6, X cannot be in 5. This allows the adjacent UX block to be placed in chapters 1-2.

Placing Greene's oil (C) with Ho on wall 2 forces a chain of deductions that leads to a remaining wall having only two watercolors, which is forbidden.

Reasoning: ","If Hidalgo's watercolor (Hw) is in a lower position, the painting above it must be an oil to prevent an all-watercolor wall (Rule 1). The only oils that can be in an upper position are Greene's (Go) or Hidalgo's (Ho), since Fo and Io are in lower positions. A wall with Ho and Hw violates the single-student rule (Rule 2). Therefore, the wall must be [Go-Upper, Hw-Lower]. This leaves Ho, Fw, and Iw for the remaining slots. The slot above Io on wall 4 must be Ho (to avoid violating rules 2 and 3). This forces Fw and Iw onto the final wall, which violates Rule 3.

```","Reasoning: Let's analyze the transaction in option C. Initially, RealProp owned the class 3 Yates and Zimmer Houses, and Southco owned the class 2 Lynch Building. In the outcome described by option C, RealProp has traded its two class 3 buildings to Southco in exchange for Southco's single class 2 building. This transaction perfectly matches the allowed trade rule: ""Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings."" The other options all describe outcomes that would require a trade that violates the given rules.

```","Reasoning: RealProp starts with one class 1 building (Garza) and no class 2 buildings. According to the rules, the only way to acquire a second class 1 building (Flores) is by trading two class 2 buildings for it. RealProp can acquire one class 2 building by trading away its two class 3 buildings. However, it has no way to acquire a second class 2 building without trading away its original class 1 building (Garza). Therefore, it is impossible for RealProp to assemble the assets needed to own two class 1 buildings simultaneously.

RealProp starts with one class 1 building and must trade it away to have only class 2 buildings. The only allowed trade for this is one class 1 for two class 2 buildings. Initially, only Trustcorp has at least two class 2 buildings to make this trade. Therefore, RealProp must trade its class 1 building to Trustcorp. Even if other trades happen first, for RealProp to meet its goal, a class 1 building (either RealProp's or Southco's) must be traded to Trustcorp in exchange for its class 2 buildings. Thus, Trustcorp must own a class 1 building.

```","Reasoning: Trustcorp starts with three class 2 buildings. To get rid of all three, it must make a specific combination of trades. The trade ""one class 1 for two class 2s"" reduces Trustcorp's class 2 count by two. The trade ""one class 2 for two class 3s"" reduces its count by one. To get from three to zero, an odd number of the second trade type must occur. Initially, only RealProp has two class 3 buildings (Yates and Zimmer). Therefore, Trustcorp must trade one of its class 2 buildings to RealProp for these two class 3 buildings.

A company can either gain two C3 buildings or lose two C3 buildings in a single trade. Trustcorp starts with zero Class 3 buildings. Therefore, the number of Class 3 buildings it owns must always be an even number (0, 2, 4, etc.). Scenario (D) is impossible because it requires Trustcorp to own the Yates House, a single Class 3 building.
