Reasoning: Based on the given constraints, the pair of Paine and Schmidt is the only one that must be on the team. If Schmidt is selected, Paine must also be selected, and vice versa. The other pairs have a lower probability of being correct, as they do not satisfy all the conditions. Therefore, the answer is option C, with a probability of 0.4.","Reasoning: If Myers is on the team, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be. If Schmidt is on the team, then both Paine and Thomson must also be. If Wong is on the team, then both Myers and Yoder must also be. Given these constraints, the only pair that satisfies the conditions is Paine and Schmidt. This is because if Schmidt is on the team, then Paine must also be on the team, and vice versa.

Question: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.Q: Which one of the following students CANNOT be assigned to 1922?

}","Reasoning: Based on the given conditions, the only painting that could also be displayed on wall 2 alongside Hidalgo's oil is option D) Hidalgo's watercolor. This is because no wall can have the work of only one student, and the conditions do not restrict Hidalgo from displaying both an oil and a watercolor on the same wall. The other options are ruled out as they would violate the conditions, such as having only one student's work on a wall or having both a Franz and an Isaacs painting on the same wall.

The conditions state that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. This means that Franz's oil must be in the lower position, and by extension, both of Franz's paintings are in the lower positions.
