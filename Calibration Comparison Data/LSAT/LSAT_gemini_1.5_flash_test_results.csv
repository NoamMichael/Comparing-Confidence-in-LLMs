","Reasoning:
The question asks which pair, if presenting on the same day, *must* present on Wednesday.  George is only available Tuesday.  The condition about Nina, Helen, and Irving implies that if Nina presents on Monday or Tuesday, Helen and Irving must present on the following day(s).  Therefore, if Nina and any other student (excluding Helen and Irving) present on the same day, it must be Wednesday to avoid violating the condition.  Only option D fits this.

","Reasoning:
Helen, Kyle, and Lenore fill the three morning slots. George must present on Tuesday.  Since only two reports are given daily, this leaves only one morning and one afternoon slot for Tuesday.  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. If Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must give reports the next day unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.  The only way to accommodate all the constraints is if Helen is Monday morning, Kyle is Tuesday morning, and Lenore is Wednesday morning. Therefore, Helen must give a report on Monday.

","Reasoning:
If O is first, and at least one composition is between O and S, then S cannot be second or third.  If O is fifth, at least one composition must be between O and S.  Given P is before S, and at least two compositions are between F and R (or vice-versa), P cannot be sixth or seventh (too close to the end to accommodate the constraints).  If P were fourth, it leaves insufficient space before S to meet the constraint that at least one composition is between O and S and P precedes S.  Therefore, P cannot be second or third either due to placement constraints with O and S.  The only remaining option is that P cannot be fourth.

","Reasoning:
Given T is fifth and F is sixth,  the condition ""T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R"" is satisfied.  O is either first or fifth, but since T is fifth, O must be first.  The condition ""at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F"" implies there's space between F and R. Since P is before S and at least one composition is between O and S, S cannot be second, third or fourth.  If S were seventh, this condition is satisfied. If S is second or third, it violates the condition that at least one composition is between O and S.  Therefore S must be either second or seventh.

If O is immediately after T, and T is either before F or after R, then T must be before F (since T cannot be after R and immediately before O).  This implies a sequence like T O ... F. At least two compositions must be between F and R, or R and F. Since O is either first or fifth, and it's after T, it must be fifth.  With at least two between F and R, and the 8th is either L or H, this leaves limited options for F's placement. Considering the conditions, F must be performed either fourth or sixth.

If two compositions are after F and before O, and O is either first or fifth,  O cannot be first. Thus, O is fifth.  T is before F or after R. Since at least two are between F and R, and two are between F and O (O is 5th), R cannot be before F. Therefore, T is after R.  The eighth is L or H. P is before S, and at least one composition is between O and S.

The question states that four scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R.  This fulfills the requirement of at least one from each discipline (botany, chemistry, zoology).  Since there's already one botanist (F) and one chemist (L), the fifth scientist must be a botanist or chemist to satisfy the condition of at least one of each type. Since F and K cannot be selected together, and we already have F, K is not possible. Options G and H are the remaining botanists. Therefore, only a botanist can be selected.  Both G and H fulfill the conditions.  There's no additional information to select definitively between G and H. Option H is not possible. Therefore G is the only possible answer.

The question states P is the only zoologist.  Since at least one botanist and one chemist are needed, and we can have at most one zoologist if more than one botanist is selected, we know at most two botanists can be selected.  Let's examine the options with this in mind. Option A and B are possible scenarios.  Option C is incorrect; L or M could be the single chemist. Option D is possible, as is Option E. Option D is the only choice that cannot be violated given the constraints, as selecting two chemists necessitates one botanist, leaving only one spot for a second botanist. If we have two chemists, we only have space for one more botanist.

","Reasoning:
Let's represent the bays with numbers 1-6.  We know livestock < grain, livestock < textiles, and textiles is next to produce.  Also, produce > fuel.  If there's one bay between machinery and grain, the order could be machinery, _, grain.  This implies livestock and textiles must be in bays 1-3, and produce must be in bays 4 or 5 (to be next to textiles). Since produce > fuel, we can deduce the positions of fuel and possibly grain. However, without more information, the exact placement of machinery is uncertain. We only know that some bay positions are constrained. Therefore, only a few cargo types' bay locations can be fully determined.

The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.Q: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?

","Reasoning:
Since only one batch is made on Friday, and three batches of each cookie are made, Friday must contain the third batch of one type of cookie. Option C suggests the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday. This is possible, as it doesn't violate any constraints given the other information about the second batches of oatmeal and sugar cookies, and the condition of at least one batch on Monday. The other options create conflicts with the given conditions.  For example, if the first peanut butter batch was Wednesday (D), and the second is with the second oatmeal (not specified day), this makes it difficult to schedule all batches.

Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and exactly two students review the same plays, and neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play Jiang reviews, and Jiang doesn't review Tamerlane, Jiang must review the remaining two plays (Sunset and Undulation), or just one of them. If Jiang reviews only one of them, that play must be reviewed by another student. However, there is no indication that another student has reviewed the same plays as Jiang. Thus, Jiang must review both Sunset and Undulation.  Since only one of the options involves only a single play review for Jiang, we can deduce that the only option that aligns with this conclusion is that Jiang reviews Sunset.

The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.Q: Which one of the following could be the assignment of the ambassadors? Answer Choices: (A)Venezuela: Jaramillo Yemen: Ong Zambia: Novetzke (B)Venezuela: Kayne Yemen: Jaramillo Zambia: Landon (C)Venezuela: Landon Yemen: Novetzke Zambia: Ong (D)Venezuela: Novetzke Yemen: Jaramillo Zambia: Kayne (E)Venezuela: Ong Yemen: Kayne Zambia: Landon

","Reasoning:
The constraints eliminate several possibilities.  If Jaramillo is assigned, so is Kayne, making options A and B impossible.  If Landon is assigned, it's to Zambia.  Since either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, are assigned, option D is impossible. Option C (Kayne and Landon) leaves Ong and one other.  Option E (Landon and Ong) satisfies all constraints: Landon to Zambia, Ong to either Venezuela or Yemen (no restriction), and either Kayne or Novetzke to the remaining country.  This allows for the condition of only one of Kayne or Novetzke being assigned.

","Reasoning: Ong to Venezuela eliminates option C because Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.  If Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne must be as well, violating the either/or rule for Kayne/Novetzke.  Therefore, Jaramillo cannot be assigned.  Landon must be assigned to Zambia. This leaves Novetzke to fill the remaining position.

","Reasoning:
We know Kayne is assigned to Yemen.  Since either Kayne or Novetzke must be assigned, and Kayne is already assigned, Novetzke is not.  If Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne must also be, which is true here.  If Ong were assigned to Venezuela, Kayne could not be in Yemen, contradicting our premise.  Therefore, Ong cannot be in Venezuela.  Landon must be in Zambia.  The only remaining option for Ong is Zambia, but that's not guaranteed.  The only statement definitively true is that Landon is in Zambia (due to a given constraint).

","Reasoning:
If Landon is assigned, it must be to Zambia (constraint 4).  Since only one person can be assigned to Zambia, options A, B, and C are possible only if Landon is *not* assigned.  However, if Landon is unassigned (option D), all three remaining spots could be filled, making it possible.  If Ong is unassigned (option E), the remaining four could fill the three positions.  Therefore, the only statement that is impossible is if both Kayne and Novetzke are assigned (violating constraint 1). But this can be true for A, B, C, D. and E.  Thus, the impossible option is (B).  If Kayne is assigned to Zambia, that leaves only Novetzke and Landon for the other two countries. Yet if Kayne is assigned to Zambia, Landon is assigned to Zambia - a contradiction.

The problem states that L is on a higher shelf than H.  Since there are only three shelves, and I is on the middle shelf, H must be on the bottom shelf.  Because at least two books are on each shelf and more are on the bottom than the top, the bottom shelf must have at least three books. Since L is above H, L must be on either the middle or top shelf.  None of the options are definitively true based solely on the placement of L and H relative to each other and the given constraints.  More information is needed to definitively determine which statement *must* be true.  The question is flawed.

Question: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.Q: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true? Answer Choices: (A)The optometrist is next to a restaurant. (B)The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. (C)A restaurant is next to the toy store. (D)The shoe store is next to the toy store. (E)The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.

","Reasoning:
The shoe store is in space 4.  The pharmacy is at one end, a restaurant at the other.  Restaurants are separated by at least two businesses. The pharmacy is next to either the optometrist or veterinarian. The toy store isn't next to the veterinarian.  Given these constraints, and the shoe store in space 4, the only arrangement that works consistently places the pharmacy at one end and a restaurant at the other, with the optometrist next to the pharmacy and a restaurant next to the shoe store. This directly satisfies option A. Options B, C, D, and E are not necessarily true given the constraints.

Let's denote modern pieces as M and traditional pieces as T.  The third solo is T. Two consecutive T's exist.  No T's before at least one M by Wayne. The fourth solo is either Wayne-T or Zara-M.  The second and fifth solos are by different pianists. To minimize Wayne's traditional solos, let's assume the two consecutive T's are solos 3 and 4.  Since solo 3 is T, solo 4 must be T (to fulfill the ""two consecutive T's"" rule).  This means solo 4 is Wayne-T (to satisfy the fourth solo condition).  Solo 1 must be Wayne-M (because no T before at least one Wayne-M). The minimum number of Wayne's traditional solos is therefore one (solo 4).

The third solo is traditional.  Two traditional solos are consecutive.  If the fifth solo is traditional, the fourth must be traditional to satisfy the consecutive requirement. This means Wayne performs a traditional piece in the fourth solo (due to the fourth solo condition). The condition that no traditional piece is performed until Wayne plays a modern piece means Wayne plays at least one modern piece before the third solo.  Since the second and fifth solos are performed by different pianists and the fifth is traditional, we can determine the pianist for the second solo.  Also, we know the type of piece for solos three, four, and five. Therefore, only one solo's details are undetermined.

This leaves only one traditional piece remaining.  Since no traditional piece is before Wayne plays a modern piece, and the third solo is traditional, Wayne must play a modern piece in the first or second solo.  Option (A) allows this condition to be met. Options B, C, D are not required and E contradicts the condition that only two consecutive traditional pieces exist. Therefore, A is possible.

Since voicemail targets cannot be 3 days, and Image's voicemail must be shorter than others, Image's voicemail must be 1 day.  Its website target cannot be longer, so it's 1 day (A).  Solide's website is shorter than Truvest's. If Truvest's voicemail is 2 days, Solide's must be 1 day.  But then Solide's website must be 1 day, contradicting Solide's website being shorter than Truvest's. Thus, Truvest's voicemail must be 2 days (E), making Solide's 1 day and its website 1 day.

Only Image's voicemail being shorter than the website target is a certainty.  However, this leads to a contradiction as Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the website target of 2 days.  If we assume a typo and Image's website target is *1* day, then the voicemail target must be even shorter (contradiction).  The question is flawed or contains contradictory information.  However, given the options, (A) is the closest, only stating it *must* be shorter.

Question: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.Q: If Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, which one of the following targets could be 2 days?

","Reasoning:
Image's voicemail target must be the shortest.  Solide's voicemail is shorter than Truvest's website.  Since Solide's website is shorter than Truvest's, Truvest's targets must be the longest. If Solide's voicemail is shorter than Truvest's website, and Truvest's targets are the longest (3 days), then Solide's voicemail could be 2 days, making Truvest's website 3 days and Truvest's voicemail also 3 days. This allows for Image's targets to be 1 day each. Therefore, Solide's voicemail target *could* be 2 days.

If J is third, the order so far is _ _ J _.  Since consecutive articles can't share a topic, the fourth article cannot be G or H (finance).  The fourth article also cannot be S (nutrition) because S must precede Y. Option A is thus impossible.  Option B (H is sixth) is possible, as is Option E (Y is fifth). However, Option C (Q is first) violates the rule that S must precede Y unless Q is third.  Option D is impossible because if S is second, then Q cannot be third, violating the conditional relationship between Q and S.

Wellspring must be before Zircon and Xpert. To place Wellspring as late as possible while still satisfying the constraints, Zircon must be in slot 2.  Therefore, the latest Wellspring can perform is slot 1. However, the question asks for the earliest possible slot for Wellspring.

","Reasoning:
Vegemite is in slot 3.  Wellspring and Zircon are before Xpert.  Uneasy is in slots 4-6. Yardsign is in slots 1-3. Since Vegemite is in slot 3, Yardsign must be in slots 1 or 2.  We know Zircon is after Vegemite (slot 3), so Zircon is in slots 4, 5, or 6.  Because Uneasy is in slots 4-6 and Xpert is after Wellspring and Zircon, Xpert must be in slot 6. Therefore, Xpert must be after Uneasy.

","Reasoning:
Since Zircon performs before Wellspring, and both are before Xpert, the earliest Xpert can perform is slot 4.  Wellspring and Zircon must occupy slots 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.  Uneasy is in slots 4-6, and Yardsign is in 1-3.  If Zircon is in slot 3, Wellspring is in 4, forcing Xpert to slot 5 or 6, and not slot 5. Therefore, none of the options are guaranteed to be true. However, if Zircon is in slot 2 and Wellspring in 3, then Xpert must be in slot 5 or 6. If Xpert is in slot 5 then option C is true.  Let's explore other possibilities. If Zircon is in 3, Wellspring is in 4, then Xpert must be in 5 or 6, so C is possible but not certain. The problem is that other constraints limit only certain outcomes.

","Reasoning:
Wellspring must be before Xpert, and since they perform consecutively, they must occupy slots 4 & 5 or 5 & 6.  Uneasy is in slots 4-6, Yardsign in 1-3, and Vegemite before Zircon, which is before Xpert.  If Wellspring is in slot 3, Xpert would be in slot 4, violating the constraint that Xpert is after Zircon. If Zircon is in slot 2, Wellspring would be in slot 3, which is impossible. If Zircon is in slot 4, Wellspring would be in slot 5. This doesn't violate any constraints.  Therefore, Zircon performing in slot four is possible.

Since the Western and Sci-fi are on the same screen (Screens 1 or 2), and Screen 3 only shows one movie at 8 PM, the Western and Sci-fi must be on Screen 1 or 2, starting at 7 PM and 9 PM.  The Western precedes the Horror film. If the Western is at 7 PM, the Horror film can't be at 8 PM on screen 3. Option C is possible. If the Western is at 7PM on screen 1 or 2 and the Sci-fi is at 9PM on the same screen, the Horror film could be on screen 3 at 8pm and the Mystery could be on screen 2 at 7pm or 9pm.  Therefore, the Romance must be on screen 3.

","Reasoning:
The romance is before the western, and the western is before the horror film.  Screen 3 only has one movie at 8 PM.  Since the romance and western are before the horror film, the horror film cannot be on screen 3. The sci-fi film isn't on screen 3 either.  The mystery and horror are on different screens. If the romance is shown before the western, it must be on either screen 1 or 2 at 7 PM. This leaves the western and horror on screens 1 and 2 at 9 PM, and only screen 2 has a remaining 7 PM slot. This makes (C) the only certain option because the mystery must be on screen 2.

The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.Q: If the violinist performs the fourth solo, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT: Answer Choices: (A)The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the violinist does. (B)The trumpeter performs a solo at some time before the violinist does. (C)The trumpeter performs a solo at some time before the guitarist does. (D)The saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the violinist does. (E)The trumpeter performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.

","Reasoning:
The violinist performs fourth.  The keyboard player is after the violinist and before the guitarist. The percussionist is before the keyboard player.  This means the percussionist is before the violinist (eliminating A).  The saxophonist is after either the percussionist OR the trumpeter, but not both. If the trumpeter is before the saxophonist, who is before the violinist, then the trumpeter is before the violinist (B).  Since the keyboard player is before the guitarist, and the trumpeter could be before the keyboard player, then the trumpeter could be before the guitarist (C). If the saxophonist is after the percussionist (before the violinist), then the saxophonist is before the violinist (D).  If the saxophonist is after the trumpeter, and the trumpeter is before the violinist, then the trumpeter is before the saxophonist (E). Only A is guaranteed to be false given the conditions.

Question: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.Q: Which one of the following is an acceptable ordering of the lectures, from first to fourth?

If the watercolors lecture is third, the oil paintings lecture must be earlier (before the 3rd position).

","Reasoning:
Holden must lecture before Garcia and Jiang. Oil and watercolor lectures precede the lithographs lecture. Farley lectures before the oil paintings lecture.  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture (D), then Garcia and Jiang must lecture after, leaving only the lithographs and watercolors lectures. This is possible.  However, if Garcia gives the watercolors lecture (C),  then Jiang must give the lithographs lecture, and Farley must speak before the oil paintings lecture, which is given by Holden,  satisfying the constraints.

Since oil and watercolors must be before lithographs, and Farley is before oil paintings, the order could be: Farley (watercolors), oil paintings, sculptures (Garcia), lithographs (Jiang/Holden).

Since one rug is solid peach, we know that five colors remain (forest, olive, turquoise, white, yellow). Olive requires peach, which is already used, so olive cannot be used.  The rules eliminate several combinations.  The only solid color left that would fulfill the rule about using five colors is yellow. If we use yellow in one rug, it must be a solid rug, as only five colors are used and adding other colors would violate rules around peach and yellow.  Therefore, one rug must be solid yellow.

Question: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.Q: If Heideck is assigned to the same graduation ceremony as Lai, then which one of the following must be true? Answer Choices: (A)Frost is assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. (B)Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony. (C)Gonzalez is assigned to neither graduation ceremony. (D)Knutson is assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. (E)Lai is assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.

","Reasoning:
If Heideck and Lai are together, and Frost must be with Heideck, then Frost, Heideck, and Lai are all at the same ceremony.  Since only two photographers can be at each ceremony,  Gonzalez, Knutson, and Mays must be at the other ceremony. This means that Lai is at the same ceremony as Heideck and Frost, and given that they must be in one ceremony together, it cannot be determined if Lai is at Silva or Thorne University, but we know that because of the constraint, Lai and Mays must be in different ceremonies.

","Reasoning:
If both Lifestyle photos are by Hue, and at least one photo per photographer must appear, Fuentes and Gagnon must have photos elsewhere.  Since no Gagnon photos are in Sports, Gagnon must have exactly two photos in Metro.  Hue has two photos in Lifestyle, so  at least one photo must be by Fuentes and at least one photo must be by Gagnon. The condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section means Fuentes must have two photos in Sports. This leaves only one slot for a Fuentes photo. Therefore, exactly one photo is by Fuentes.

Lifestyle has one Gagnon and one Hue photo.  Since at least one Lifestyle photo must share a photographer with a Metro photo, and Gagnon can't be in Sports, a Metro photo must be by Gagnon or Hue.  If a Metro photo is by Hue, that leaves only one photographer's photos for Sports (Fuentes), violating the condition that each photographer has at least one photo. Therefore, at least one Metro photo must be by Gagnon.  Since there are only two photos in the Metro section, and Gagnon must have at least one, and no more than three, either one or two Metro photos are by Gagnon.  Option B is the only possibility that aligns with these constraints.

At least one Lifestyle photo must share a photographer with a Metro photo.  Hue's Lifestyle photos equal Fuentes' Sports photos. Option A violates the constraint of at most three photos per photographer. Options C and D are impossible since Hue's Lifestyle count equals Fuentes' Sports count,  creating contradictions.

If M is published in the fall, N must be in the spring.  P cannot be in the fall with M. K and N must be in the same season, so K must be spring.  If K is spring, O can be either fall or spring. Therefore, only O and L are possibilities to be published in the fall with M.  Option C (L and O) fits this condition.

","Reasoning: The original condition creates a constraint: if M is fall, N must be spring.  We need a replacement condition that enforces the same restriction. Option (D) achieves this.

If Yoshio is excluded, we need a group of four from the remaining five.  Since only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, let's consider scenarios. If Tiffany is chosen, Ryan and Onyx are required (Onyx in 1922, Ryan in 1923). This leaves one spot.  If Louis is chosen, he could be assigned to 1924, making (E) true. If Louis is not chosen,  Mollie could fill the remaining spot.  Options A, B, and C are contradicted by possible scenarios. Option D is not guaranteed. Therefore, only option E remains plausible.

Question: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.Q: Which one of the following students CANNOT be assigned to 1922?

","Reasoning:
If Tiffany is assigned, Ryan must be assigned, and Onyx must be assigned the year before Ryan.  This means if Ryan is in 1922, Onyx would be in 1921, leaving only 1923 and 1924 for Louis and Tiffany. Since only Louis or Tiffany can be in 1923, this scenario works.  However, if Mollie is in 1922, the other years are already filled.  Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922.  The other students could potentially be assigned to 1922 given different scenarios.

The sundial is before the mirror and vase. The table is before either the harmonica or vase, but not both.  If the vase is on June 6th, the sundial and mirror must be earlier.

","Reasoning: The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and vase.  The table is before either the harmonica or vase, but not both.

Question: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.Q: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?

Isaacs's oil is on wall 4, and his watercolor is on wall 2. Franz's oil is on wall 3.  Since no wall can have only one student's work, and no wall has only watercolors, and Franz and Isaacs cannot be on the same wall, wall 3 must also have a watercolor (not Franz's).
