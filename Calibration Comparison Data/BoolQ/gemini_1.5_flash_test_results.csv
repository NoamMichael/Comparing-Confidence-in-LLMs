0,"does ethanol take more energy than it produces?
Response:
","Response:
  'Reasoning': Ethanol production requires energy for planting, harvesting, processing, and transportation. While fermentation itself releases energy, the net energy balance depends heavily on the feedstock and production methods.  Using corn as feedstock often results in a net energy deficit, while using cellulosic biomass may yield a net energy gain.  Thus, it's not universally true that ethanol takes more energy than it produces.
