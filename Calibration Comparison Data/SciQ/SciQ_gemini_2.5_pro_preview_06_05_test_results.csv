Question: Compounds that are capable of accepting electrons, such as o 2 or f2, are called what?
Options:
A) antioxidants

```","Reasoning: By definition, a substance that accepts electrons from another substance in a chemical reaction is called an oxidant or an oxidizing agent. This process, where the oxidant gains electrons, is known as reduction, and it simultaneously causes the other substance to be oxidized (lose electrons). The examples provided, O₂ and F₂, are highly electronegative and are therefore strong oxidants. An antioxidant is the opposite; it donates electrons. ""Oxygen"" is an example, not the general term.

The other options are incorrect. ""Adult"" refers to a developmental stage, ""male"" refers to a sex, and ""phenotype"" refers to the observable physical traits of an organism, which result from the interaction of its genotype and the environment.

Long-chain hydrocarbons have a larger surface area compared to short-chain ones, leading to stronger temporary attractions (London dispersion forces) between molecules. These stronger forces make it more difficult for the molecules to slide past one another. This increased resistance to flow means that long-chain hydrocarbons are highly viscous. For example, tar and motor oil (long chains) are much more viscous than gasoline (shorter chains).

When mixed in equal molar amounts, they completely react to form water and a salt (sodium chloride). Since both the acid and base are strong, the resulting salt does not hydrolyze water to create an excess of H+ or OH- ions. This means the solution is neither acidic nor basic, but neutral, with a pH of approximately 7. The other options are not relevant chemical descriptions of the resulting solution.

In fungi like black bread mold, the multicellular mycelium is haploid. The diploid (2n) stage is very brief, typically just the zygote (zygospore), which quickly undergoes meiosis to produce haploid spores. Therefore, the life cycle is dominated by the haploid phase.

The evolution of pollen eliminated this need by creating a package for the male gametes that could be transported by wind or animals. The evolution of the seed provided a protective, nutrient-rich package for the embryo, protecting it from desiccation and allowing it to remain dormant until conditions were favorable.

For a skydiver, the net force is the difference between their downward weight and the upward air drag. As the skydiver's speed increases, air drag increases until it equals their weight.

Hybrids are the offspring of two different species. For an organism to produce viable gametes (sperm or eggs) through meiosis, homologous chromosomes from each parent must pair up. In many hybrids, the chromosomes inherited from the different parent species are not homologous; they differ in structure or number. This prevents proper pairing during meiosis, leading to the formation of genetically imbalanced and non-viable gametes, which causes sterility.

A hydrogen atom possesses only one electron, which occupies its outermost shell, making it a single valence electron. To achieve a stable electron configuration (a full outer shell), hydrogen shares this one electron with another atom, thus allowing it to form only one covalent bond.

The most common anionic detergents have heads derived from sulfuric or sulfonic acids. Therefore, alongside sulfates (R-O-SO₃⁻), the other major class is sulfonates (R-SO₃⁻). Linear alkylbenzene sulfonates are a prominent example. Phosphates were used as builders in detergents, not typically as the primary ionic head of the surfactant molecule itself.
