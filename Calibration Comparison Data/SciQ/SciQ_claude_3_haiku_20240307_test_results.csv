The magnesium rod acts as the anode in a galvanic cell. In a galvanic cell, the more easily oxidized metal (magnesium) is connected to the less easily oxidized metal (iron in the steel pipeline), creating a potential difference. This potential difference drives the flow of electrons from the magnesium anode to the steel cathode, protecting the pipeline from corrosion. Since the magnesium has a lower standard reduction potential than iron, it is the sacrificial anode in this galvanic cell.

The key to this question lies in the concept of total internal reflection in optical fibers. Since optical fibers are thin, the light entering the fiber may strike the inside surface at an angle greater than the critical angle, which is determined by the refractive index of the fiber material.

The key difference between oils and fats at room temperature is their physical state. Oils are typically liquid at room temperature, while fats are solid. This is due to the differences in their chemical composition, specifically the degree of saturation. Oils are generally more unsaturated, meaning they have fewer hydrogen atoms bonded to the carbon chain, resulting in a lower melting point and a liquid state at room temperature. Fats, on the other hand, are more saturated, leading to a higher melting point and a solid state at room temperature. Therefore, the correct answer is B) liquid and solid states.

This is due to the inverse square law of gravity, where the gravitational force between the sun and the planet decreases as the square of the distance between them. Therefore, the farther the planet is from the sun, the longer it takes to complete one full orbit. The size, age, and direction of the planet's orbit play a lesser role in determining the orbital period. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D) distance.

The plasma membrane is composed of a lipid bilayer, and cholesterol molecules are integral components that help maintain the membrane's structural integrity and fluidity. Cholesterol inserts itself between the fatty acid tails of the phospholipids, preventing them from packing too closely together and providing the membrane with the necessary rigidity and flexibility. This helps the plasma membrane retain its shape and perform its vital functions. Therefore, option A, cholesterol, is the correct answer based on the given information.
