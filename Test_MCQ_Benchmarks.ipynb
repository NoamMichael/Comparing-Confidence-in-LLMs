The lease length for each house is one, two, or three semesters. The following conditions must hold: No student house has a three-semester lease. At least two houses each have longer leases than does the house closest to campus. Every student house (if there are any) is farther from campus than any faculty house (if there are any).

This creates a block of three people: Osata, Poirier, and Londi. Since Klosnik does not sit next to Manley, and Londi sits next to Manley, Klosnik must sit next to Manley. However, this would leave Neri as the only person left to sit next to Manley, but Londi already sits next to Manley, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, Londi cannot sit next to Poirier, and Osata must sit next to Poirier.\",\n          \"<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nGiven the following question, analyze the options, and provide a concise reasoning for your selected answer.

There are exactly six chairs evenly spaced around a circular table. The chairs are numbered 1 through 6, with successively numbered chairs next to each other and chair number 1 next to chair number 6. Each chair is occupied by exactly one of the representatives. The following conditions apply: Poirier sits immediately next to Neri. Londi sits immediately next to Manley, Neri, or both. Klosnik does not sit immediately next to Manley.

With Londi next to Manley, the arrangement becomes: Manley-Londi-?. Since Klosnik cannot sit next to Manley, Klosnik must sit in chair 1 or 6.
