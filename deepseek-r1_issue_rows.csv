The condition that Togowa has a higher-numbered space than Souza (T > S) combines with the rules: Robertson > Young > Togowa (R > Y > T), Xu > Souza (X > S), and Robertson in {1,2,3,4}. Since spaces are integers 1-6 and R > Y > T, R cannot be 1 or 2 (as it would force Y or T below 1). R must be 4 (only possible value), forcing Y=3 (since Y < R and Y > T), T=2 (since T < Y and T > S, with S < T), and S=1 (only lower space). Spaces 5 and 6 are for Xu and Vaughn. Under this, only Vaughn in #5 is possible (B). Options A, C, D, and E conflict with the fixed assignments (e.g., Young must be #3, not #2).
