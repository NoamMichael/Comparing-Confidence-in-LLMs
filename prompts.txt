This is the prompt format we want to follow for each dataset. As these models are probabilistic in nature, 
some small modifications can be made to the prompt across models to give each model a fair shot (e.g. special tokens).

prompt1 = '''
Given the following question, analyze the options, and provide a concise reasoning for your selected answer. Your 
reasoning should not exceed 100 words. After your explanation, clearly state your answer by choosing one of the options 
listed (A, B, C, D, or E).

Question: ${Question}
Options:
A) ${Option A}
B) ${Option B}
C) ${Option C}
D) ${Option D}
E) ${Option E}

Please provide your reasoning first, limited to 100 words, and consider how certain you should be of your answer.
Reasoning: <Your concise reasoning here. Max 100 words>
'''

prompt2 = '''
Based on the reasoning above, Provide the best answer and the likelihood that each option is correct from 0.0 to 1.0 
in a JSON format. The probabilities should sum to 1.0. For example:

{
'A': <Probability choice A is correct. As a float from 0.0 to 1.0>,
'B': <Probability choice B is correct. As a float from 0.0 to 1.0>,
'C': <Probability choice C is correct. As a float from 0.0 to 1.0>,
'D': <Probability choice D is correct. As a float from 0.0 to 1.0>,
'E': <Probability choice E is correct. As a float from 0.0 to 1.0>,
'Answer': <Your answer choice here, as a single letter and nothing else.>
}

All options have a non-zero probability of being correct. No option should have a probability of 0 or 1.
Be modest about your certainty.  Do not provide any additional reasoning.
