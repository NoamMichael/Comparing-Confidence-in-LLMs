"This question asks about the energy balance of ethanol production - whether it takes more energy to produce ethanol than the energy content of the ethanol itself. This is a complex topic that depends on several factors: the feedstock used (corn, sugarcane, cellulosic materials), production methods, transportation, and what energy inputs are counted. For corn ethanol in the US, studies have shown mixed results, with some indicating a slightly positive energy balance (1.3-1.8 energy units out per unit in) while others suggest it's closer to break-even. Sugarcane ethanol generally has a much better energy balance. The question is somewhat ambiguous in its wording ('take more energy make that produces'), but I interpret it as asking whether production energy exceeds output energy. Based on current research, most modern ethanol production methods do produce more energy than they consume, though the margin varies significantly.",False,0.7,True,"{

"House tax and property tax are essentially the same thing in most contexts.

"This question appears to be asking about phantom pain, which is a well-documented medical phenomenon. Phantom pain occurs when people experience pain sensations in body parts that have been amputated or are no longer functional. This happens because the brain and nervous system continue to send pain signals even though the physical body part is missing or cannot send sensory information. Phantom limb pain is experienced by a significant percentage of amputees. Additionally, people with paralyzed areas can sometimes experience pain in those regions despite lack of normal sensation or movement. The neurological basis for these phenomena is well-established in medical literature.",True,0.95,True,"{

"The concept of 'breaking in' a car refers to a period of gentle driving when a vehicle is new to allow engine components to properly seat and wear together. Historically, this was very important for older vehicles with less precise manufacturing tolerances. Modern cars (roughly 2000s onward) have much tighter manufacturing tolerances and better materials, making traditional break-in periods less critical. However, most manufacturers still recommend a brief break-in period (typically first 500-1000 miles) with guidelines like avoiding extreme speeds, heavy loads, or aggressive driving. While not as crucial as it once was, following break-in recommendations can still benefit engine longevity and performance.

"In Catholic doctrine, last rites (more formally called the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick or Extreme Unction) can normally only be administered by an ordained priest. However, in emergency situations where death is imminent and no priest is available, the Catholic Church does allow for exceptions. Any baptized person can perform an emergency baptism if needed, and while they cannot perform the full last rites sacrament, they can pray with and for the dying person. Some sources indicate that in truly dire emergencies, deacons may also be permitted to perform certain aspects of last rites.

In the United States, federal law (National Firearms Act) regulates the minimum overall length of shotguns - they must be at least 26 inches overall with a barrel of at least 18 inches. Cutting the stock could potentially make the firearm illegal if it reduces the overall length below 26 inches. Additionally, state and local laws may have their own restrictions.

"The latent heat of vaporization is the energy required to convert a liquid to vapor at constant temperature and pressure. While it's often treated as a constant in introductory physics, it actually does vary with temperature. As temperature increases and approaches the critical point, the latent heat of vaporization decreases because the difference in density between liquid and vapor phases becomes smaller. At the critical temperature, the latent heat of vaporization becomes zero as the distinction between liquid and vapor phases disappears. This temperature dependence is well-established in thermodynamics and can be described by equations like the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.",True,0.95,True,"{

This occurs through several natural processes: 1) Some tree species naturally grow multiple trunks from a single root system (like many birch and oak species), 2) Trees can develop multiple trunks after the main trunk is damaged, causing new shoots to grow from the base, 3) Some trees naturally fork very low to the ground, creating what appears to be multiple trunks, and 4) Certain species like banyan trees develop aerial roots that become additional trunk-like structures.

"Maple syrup does not come straight from the tree in its final form. What comes directly from maple trees is maple sap, which is a thin, watery liquid that contains only about 2-3% sugar. To make maple syrup, this sap must be collected and then boiled down to concentrate the sugars, removing most of the water. It typically takes about 40 gallons of sap to make 1 gallon of maple syrup.

"Perfect pitch (absolute pitch) is the ability to identify or produce specific musical notes without a reference point. Research suggests that while there may be some genetic predisposition, perfect pitch is not something you must be 'born with' in the sense of being fully developed at birth. Studies indicate that perfect pitch typically develops during a critical period in early childhood (roughly ages 3-6) when exposed to musical training. Some people may have a genetic advantage that makes them more likely to develop it, but the ability itself requires environmental factors like early musical exposure and training. Additionally, there is some evidence that adults can develop quasi-perfect pitch or improve their pitch recognition abilities through intensive training, though true perfect pitch is much rarer to acquire after the critical period.",False,0.85,True,"{

"In poker, a straight is five consecutive cards of any suit. The sequence A-2-3-4-5 is indeed a valid straight, commonly called a 'wheel' or 'bicycle.' In this case, the ace is played as a low card (value of 1) rather than high (value of 14). This is one of only two ways an ace can be used in a straight - either as the low card in A-2-3-4-5 or as the high card in 10-J-Q-K-A.

So while some biological adaptation occurs, it's more accurate to call it 'tolerance' rather than true 'immunity.'"",

During transcription, only one of the two DNA strands (called the template strand or antisense strand) is used as a template to synthesize RNA. The RNA polymerase reads the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction and synthesizes the RNA transcript in the 5' to 3' direction. The resulting RNA sequence is complementary to the template strand and has the same sequence as the non-template strand (coding strand), except with uracil instead of thymine.

"Dairy cows, like all mammals, must become pregnant and give birth to begin lactating (producing milk). The biological process of milk production is triggered by hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy and after giving birth. Once a cow has calved (given birth), she will continue to produce milk for several months (typically 10-12 months) even after the calf is weaned. However, to maintain continuous milk production in commercial dairy operations, cows are typically bred again while still lactating.

"In basketball, goaltending occurs when a player interferes with a shot that is on its downward trajectory toward the basket or when a player touches the ball while it's above the rim and has a chance to go in. However, if the ball hits the backboard below the rim, it means the shot was not on a trajectory that could result in a score, as it would need to hit above or at rim level to have a chance of going in.

"This question requires comparing the physiological effects of cold water baths versus ice baths. Ice baths typically involve water temperatures around 50-59°F (10-15°C), while cold water baths are generally warmer, around 60-70°F (15-21°C). Research shows that ice baths provide more pronounced benefits for recovery, inflammation reduction, and muscle soreness relief due to the more extreme temperature. The colder temperature in ice baths triggers stronger vasoconstriction, reduces metabolic activity more effectively, and provides greater anti-inflammatory effects. While cold water baths do provide some benefits, they are generally less effective than ice baths for athletic recovery and therapeutic purposes. However, the definition of 'as good' could vary depending on the specific purpose and individual tolerance.",False,0.8,True,"{

Milk is a liquid with a density different from water (typically around 1.03-1.04 g/cm³ due to dissolved solids like proteins, fats, and lactose), so a hydrometer can indeed measure its density.

"The question refers to 'cow tipping,' which is a supposed prank where people push over a standing cow. However, this is largely a myth. Cows are very large animals (typically 1,000-1,500 pounds) with a low center of gravity and strong legs. They are extremely difficult to tip over, and it would require multiple people with significant force. Additionally, cows don't actually sleep standing up like horses do - they lie down to rest. If a cow were somehow knocked over (which is highly unlikely under normal circumstances), they are physically capable of getting back up on their own, as they regularly lie down and stand up as part of their normal behavior. Cows have strong leg muscles and the ability to roll and push themselves upright.",True,0.95,True,"{

Both are simple sugars with identical molecular structure and properties. The '5' likely refers to a 5% concentration solution, which would be equivalent whether labeled as glucose or dextrose.

"Nuclear power and nuclear energy are closely related terms but have slightly different meanings. Nuclear energy refers to the energy released from nuclear reactions (fission or fusion), while nuclear power specifically refers to the use of nuclear energy to generate electricity in power plants. Nuclear energy is the broader concept encompassing all energy from nuclear reactions, while nuclear power is the practical application of nuclear energy for electricity generation.

While entangled particles do exhibit instantaneous correlations when measured, this phenomenon cannot be used to transmit information faster than light.

This dual nature allows aces to be used in both high straights (10-J-Q-K-A) and low straights (A-2-3-4-5, also called a 'wheel' or 'bicycle'). This is a well-established rule in virtually all poker variants. The ace can indeed function as a 1 in specific situations, particularly in low straights and in some lowball poker games."",

"Yes, there is a significant difference between Old English Bulldogs and English Bulldogs. The Old English Bulldog was the original breed that existed from roughly the 13th to 19th centuries, used primarily for bull-baiting. These dogs were taller, more athletic, had longer legs, and were more aggressive than modern English Bulldogs. When bull-baiting was banned in 1835, the breed nearly went extinct. The modern English Bulldog was developed in the late 1800s through selective breeding to create a gentler, more compact companion dog with the characteristic flat face, stocky build, and docile temperament we see today. The 'Old English Bulldog' name is also used for some modern recreation breeds that attempt to recreate the original type. This is well-documented historical and breed information.",True,0.95,True,"{

This change occurred most recently when King Charles III ascended to the throne in 2022, replacing 'God Save the Queen' (for Queen Elizabeth II) with 'God Save the King.'"",

This film was indeed based on a true story - specifically, the experiences at Miss Porter's School in Connecticut during the 1960s when the school was considering going co-educational. The screenplay was inspired by real events and the director's own research into the period. However, without more specific context about which 'All I Wanna Do' is being referenced, there's some uncertainty, though the 1998 film is the most likely candidate for this question."",

"The water table is the upper boundary of the zone of saturation in groundwater systems. Its depth varies significantly based on multiple factors including: topography (it generally follows surface contours but is more subdued), seasonal precipitation patterns, local geology and soil permeability, human activities like pumping or irrigation, proximity to surface water bodies, and climate conditions. In areas with high rainfall or near rivers/lakes, the water table is typically shallow, while in arid regions or elevated areas it can be very deep.

However, in common usage, the terms are often used interchangeably, and pure talcum powder can be essentially just finely ground talc."",

"In baseball, when a foul ball is caught by a fielder, it counts as an out. Once the ball is caught, it becomes a live ball situation.

Home equity is generally considered an illiquid asset because: 1) You cannot directly access the cash value without selling the home or obtaining a loan against it, 2) Selling a home typically takes weeks or months, 3) There are significant transaction costs involved (realtor fees, closing costs, etc.), and 4) Home values can fluctuate. While you can access some equity through home equity loans or lines of credit, the equity itself is not liquid - these are borrowing mechanisms that use the equity as collateral. The question asks specifically about equity being liquid, not about ways to borrow against it.",False,0.95,True,"{

"Chicago Fire is a TV drama series that premiered in 2012. From what I know about the show's production, it is primarily filmed in Chicago and uses real locations throughout the city to maintain authenticity. The show does use actual firehouses for filming, including Engine 18's firehouse, which serves as the exterior of Firehouse 51 in the show. However, interior scenes are typically filmed on constructed sets in studios rather than inside working firehouses, as this allows for better camera work, lighting, and doesn't interfere with actual fire department operations.

"MLB games can end in ties, but this is extremely rare in modern baseball. Ties typically occur when a game is suspended due to weather, darkness, or other circumstances after it has become an official game (5+ innings) and the score is tied. The game would then be resumed from that point at a later date. However, if the game cannot be resumed (such as late in the season when it wouldn't affect playoff standings), it could officially end as a tie. There have been a few documented cases of MLB games ending in ties, particularly in earlier eras of baseball when lighting was poor and games were more frequently called due to darkness.

'Futility, or the Wreck of the Titan' was written by Morgan Robertson and published in 1898, 14 years before the actual Titanic sinking in 1912.

"Reverse osmosis (RO) and deionized (DI) water are both purified water types, but they are produced through different processes and have different characteristics. RO uses a semi-permeable membrane to remove dissolved solids, bacteria, and other contaminants, typically removing 95-99% of dissolved minerals. Deionized water is produced by passing water through ion exchange resins that remove charged particles (ions), resulting in very low conductivity.

"Rice naturally comes in different varieties, including white and brown rice. White rice is not made white through bleaching - it becomes white through a milling process that removes the outer bran layer and germ from brown rice. The bran layer is what gives brown rice its color and many of its nutrients. When this layer is removed during processing, the remaining endosperm is naturally white/translucent. This is a mechanical process, not a chemical bleaching process. Some rice may undergo polishing to make it shinier, but this is also a mechanical process, not bleaching.",False,0.95,True,"{

In other sports like American football or basketball, the concept of 'away goals' doesn't typically apply in the same way.

There have been documented cases of horse fatalities at major racing events, and the Kentucky Derby would not be immune to such incidents."",

By definition, ∅ ∈ {∅} means that the empty set is one of the elements listed inside the braces of the set {∅}. Since {∅} is defined as the set whose only element is the empty set, then yes, ∅ is indeed an element of {∅}. This is a fundamental concept in set theory - we must distinguish between 'is an element of' (∈) and 'is a subset of' (⊆).

"I need to consider the historical development of presidential systems of government. The United States established the office of President with George Washington in 1789 under the Constitution. However, I should consider whether other countries had similar executive positions called 'president' earlier. The term 'president' comes from Latin meaning 'to sit before' or 'preside over.' While the U.S. was among the first to use this specific title for a head of state in a republic, there were earlier examples of similar positions.

"According to Maxwell's equations, specifically Ampère's circuital law as modified by Maxwell, both conduction current and displacement current contribute to the magnetic field. The modified Ampère's law states that ∇ × B = μ₀(J + ∂D/∂t), where J is the conduction current density and ∂D/∂t is the displacement current density. This means that a changing electric field (displacement current) produces a magnetic field just as a conduction current does.

"Svalbard is a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. While it is under Norwegian sovereignty, it has a unique legal status under the Svalbard Treaty of 1920. This treaty allows citizens of signatory countries to enter and work in Svalbard without a visa, regardless of their relationship with Norway. However, since you must transit through mainland Norway to reach Svalbard (typically through Oslo or Tromsø), you would need to meet Norway's entry requirements for that transit.

"Being flat-footed (pes planus) was historically a disqualifying condition for military service in many countries, including the US military. However, military medical standards have evolved significantly over time. Currently, flat feet alone are generally not an automatic disqualifier for military service in most modern militaries, including the US Armed Forces. The condition is evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering factors like severity, associated symptoms (pain, functional limitations), and the specific military role. Mild to moderate flat feet without pain or functional impairment typically do not prevent military service.

Lymphoma can occur in lymph nodes, but it can also affect other parts of the lymphatic system like the spleen, bone marrow, thymus, and other organs. There are two main types: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

"A shear wall is a structural wall designed to resist lateral forces (like wind and seismic forces) by transferring them to the foundation. While shear walls are primarily designed for lateral load resistance, they can also carry vertical loads (gravity loads) and thus function as load-bearing walls. However, not all shear walls are necessarily load-bearing - some may be designed purely for lateral resistance without carrying significant vertical loads. The relationship depends on the specific structural design and requirements. Since the question asks if 'a shear wall' is load-bearing without specifying context, and given that many shear walls do carry vertical loads in addition to their primary lateral load function, the most accurate general answer is that shear walls can be and often are load-bearing walls.",True,0.8,True,"{

"Motion sickness after a cruise is indeed a well-documented phenomenon known as 'mal de débarquement syndrome' or 'land sickness.' When people spend several days on a ship, their inner ear and balance system adapt to the constant motion of the vessel. Upon returning to solid ground, the body needs time to readjust to the stable environment, which can cause symptoms like dizziness, unsteadiness, and a sensation of still being in motion. This typically resolves within a few hours to a few days for most people.

During a cruise, your inner ear (which controls balance) adapts to the constant motion of the ship.

This can cause symptoms like dizziness, unsteadiness, feeling like you're still swaying or rocking, and general balance issues.

However, nicotine is not primarily classified as a ganglion blocker - it's more accurately described as a nicotinic receptor agonist that can cause secondary blockade. True ganglion blockers like hexamethonium or mecamylamine are competitive or non-competitive antagonists that primarily block rather than initially stimulate receptors."",

Developmental psychologists study cognitive, emotional, social, and physical changes throughout all life stages, whereas child psychologists concentrate specifically on the pediatric population. Therefore, they are not the same, though they overlap significantly."",

"The Great Depression, which began with the U.S. stock market crash in 1929, had widespread global effects due to international trade connections, financial interdependence, and economic policies of the time. Major economies like Germany, Britain, France, Canada, and Australia experienced significant economic downturns. However, the impact varied considerably by country - some nations like the Soviet Union were relatively insulated due to their limited integration with global markets, and certain countries recovered at different rates. While the depression was indeed a global phenomenon that affected most of the world's major economies, saying it affected 'the whole world' might be an overstatement as some regions and countries experienced less severe impacts or were more isolated from global economic systems.",True,0.85,True,"{

In the United States, the legal drinking age is 21, making it illegal for those under 21 to purchase or publicly consume alcohol in most circumstances. However, there are some exceptions (like religious ceremonies or parental supervision in private settings in some states). In many other countries, the legal drinking age is lower (18 or even younger). Since the question doesn't specify location or context, and given that it mentions '21' which is specifically the US drinking age, I'll assume it's asking about US law.

"Cows do not produce milk continuously throughout their lives. Like all mammals, cows only produce milk after giving birth to feed their offspring. Dairy cows are typically artificially inseminated and give birth to calves, after which they begin lactating. The lactation period usually lasts about 10 months, during which milk production gradually decreases. After this period, cows have a 'dry period' of about 2 months before being bred again. So while dairy cows spend most of their productive years in lactation due to managed breeding cycles, they do not produce milk literally 'all the time' - there are dry periods and they don't lactate before their first pregnancy or after they stop being bred.",False,0.95,True,"{

For open carry, New Hampshire has generally allowed this without a license for those legally allowed to possess firearms.

"In an adiabatic process, there is no heat transfer (Q = 0) between the system and its surroundings. However, work can still be done by or on the system. According to the first law of thermodynamics, ΔU = Q - W, where ΔU is the change in internal energy, Q is heat, and W is work done by the system. In an adiabatic process, since Q = 0, we have ΔU = -W. This means that any work done by the system comes from its internal energy, and any work done on the system increases its internal energy. Common examples include adiabatic compression and expansion of gases, where work is clearly being done even though no heat is exchanged.

"Cows, like all mammals, produce milk primarily to feed their offspring. A cow must become pregnant and give birth to a calf to initiate lactation. After giving birth, a cow will continue to produce milk for several months (typically 10-12 months in dairy operations), but milk production gradually decreases over time. To maintain consistent milk production, dairy cows are typically bred again while still lactating, usually 2-3 months after giving birth.

"This question asks about club professionals winning the PGA Championship. The PGA Championship is one of golf's four major championships. In the early years of the PGA Championship (starting in 1916), many winners were indeed club professionals rather than touring professionals, as the distinction between club pros and tour pros wasn't as clear-cut as it is today. Notable early winners included club professionals like Jim Barnes, Walter Hagen (who was both), and others. However, if the question is asking about modern times when there's a clear distinction between club pros and tour pros, it becomes much rarer.

While it involves neurons that control motor function, it is typically classified as a hereditary spastic paraplegia or corticospinal tract disorder rather than being grouped with classical motor neuron diseases. The classification can vary somewhat in different medical contexts, but the predominant view is that HSP is distinct from typical motor neuron diseases."",

"A characteristic property (also called intensive property) is a property that depends only on the type of matter, not on the amount of matter present. Boiling point is the temperature at which a substance changes from liquid to gas phase at a given pressure. This temperature is specific to each pure substance and does not change based on how much of the substance you have. For example, water always boils at 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure, whether you have 1 mL or 1 L of water. This makes boiling point a characteristic property that can be used to identify and distinguish between different substances.",True,0.95,True,"{
