"Based on population statistics for American males, the average life expectancy is around 76 years. However, this is just a statistical average and individual lifespans can vary significantly. Without any additional information about the person's health, lifestyle, or other factors, the best estimate would be to use the general life expectancy as a starting point. Given that the person has already lived at least 0 years, I would estimate they will live to around 76 years old. I am reasonably confident in this estimate, but there is still a fair amount of uncertainty, so I would assign a confidence level of around 0.7.",76,0.7,True,"{

"Based on population statistics, the average life expectancy for an American male is around 76 years. However, since the person has already lived at least 0 years, we can assume they have already survived the highest risk period of childhood and infancy. Therefore, their remaining life expectancy is likely higher than the general population average. Additionally, factors like socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and lifestyle choices can significantly impact longevity. Given the limited information provided, a reasonable estimate would be that the person will live to around 80-85 years old. I am fairly confident in this range, as it accounts for the person having already reached adulthood, while also considering potential variability in life expectancy. My confidence that the true age at death falls within 5 years of this estimate is around 0.8 or 80%.",83,0.8,True,"Question:
Given that an American male has lived at least 0 years, estimate how old he will be when he dies. How certain are you that your answer is within 5 years of the true value?

Individuals who reach older ages tend to have a higher remaining life expectancy compared to the general population. Based on actuarial tables, a 78-year-old American male has an average remaining life expectancy of around 9 years. Therefore, my best estimate is that this person will live to approximately 87 years old. I am fairly confident in this estimate, as the remaining life expectancy for a 78-year-old male is well-documented, and the person has already exceeded the average life expectancy. However, there is still some uncertainty, as individual health factors can impact longevity. Therefore, I would estimate a confidence level of around 0.8 that the person's actual age at death will be within 5 years of my estimate of 87 years old."",

According to the latest life expectancy data from the CDC, the average life expectancy for American females is around 79 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancies can vary significantly based on various factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and access to healthcare. Given that the person has already lived 23 years, they have already surpassed the average life expectancy for American females at birth (around 79 years). Therefore, I would estimate that this person will likely live to be around 85 years old, which is a reasonable estimate considering they have already lived past the average life expectancy. My confidence in this estimate being within 1 year of the true value is relatively high, around 0.8 or 80%, as life expectancy data provides a good general guideline, but individual variations can still occur."",

According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the average life expectancy for American females is around 79 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancies can vary significantly based on various factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and access to healthcare. Since the person has already lived 28 years, they have already exceeded the average life expectancy for American females by a significant margin. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that they will likely live longer than the average. Considering this, I would estimate that the person will live to be around 85 years old. I am fairly confident that my estimate is within 20 years of the true value, as the person has already exceeded the average life expectancy and is likely to continue living a healthy and active life. My confidence in this estimate is 0.8, or 80%."",

    ""Reasoning"": ""Based on population statistics, the average life expectancy for American females is around 79 years. Since the person has already lived 40 years, they have a remaining life expectancy of around 39 years. However, this is just an average, and individual factors such as health, lifestyle, and genetics can significantly impact lifespan. Given the person has already reached 40 years, they are likely to live longer than the average, perhaps closer to the upper end of the life expectancy range for American females. Therefore, I estimate the person will live to around 85 years old. I am reasonably confident in this estimate, as it takes into account both the average life expectancy and the fact that the person has already surpassed the average life expectancy for their age and gender. My confidence in this answer being within 1 year of the true value is around 0.8 or 80%."",
