"Compounds that accept electrons in chemical reactions are oxidizing agents or oxidants. They cause oxidation in other substances by taking electrons from them. Oxygen (O2) and fluorine (F2) are classic examples of oxidants because they readily accept electrons. Antioxidants do the opposite - they donate electrons.

"Short period comets (those with orbital periods less than 200 years) primarily originate from the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit. The Kuiper Belt is a known reservoir of cometary nuclei that can be perturbed into the inner solar system. The Milky Way is our galaxy, not a source of comets. The 'Vesta belt' is not a recognized astronomical term (Vesta is an asteroid). The 'photon belt' is a pseudoscientific concept, not recognized in astronomy.",A,0.95,0.02,0.02,0.01,True,"{

"Implantation refers to the process where a fertilized egg (blastocyst) attaches to the uterine lining. After implantation, the embryo continues developing and eventually becomes a fetus. This is a specific developmental stage in mammals, including humans. The embryo is already a living thing before implantation, and not all embryos develop into mammals or humans specifically.",D,0.05,0.05,0.0,0.9,True,"{

"Atoms with unstable nuclei undergo radioactive decay to achieve stability. This process involves the emission of radiation (alpha, beta, or gamma). These atoms are specifically defined as radioactive elements or isotopes in chemistry and physics. While they are indeed unstable, option B is too general.

"Atmospheric sulfur primarily exists as sulfur dioxide (SO2), which is released from volcanic eruptions, fossil fuel combustion, and industrial processes. While sulfuric acid (H2SO4) can form in the atmosphere from SO2 through oxidation reactions, it's a secondary product.
