0,"The question is asking whether the production of ethanol requires more energy input than the energy it yields when used as a fuel. This is a complex question that has been studied extensively. The energy return on investment (EROI) for ethanol depends on many factors including feedstock (corn, sugarcane, cellulosic), production methods, and technological advancements. For corn ethanol in the US, earlier studies suggested negative energy balance, but more recent analyses with improved production efficiencies show slightly positive returns. Sugarcane ethanol from Brazil has a more favorable energy balance. The scientific consensus has evolved over time, and there are still debates in the literature. Given the complexity and ongoing research in this area, I cannot make a definitive statement that applies universally to all ethanol production.",False,0.6,True,"{

1,"House tax and property tax are often used interchangeably in common language, but there can be technical differences depending on the jurisdiction. Property tax is generally a broader term that encompasses taxes on all types of real estate (residential, commercial, land) and sometimes personal property. House tax could specifically refer to taxes on residential buildings. However, in most contexts, when people refer to 'house tax,' they are indeed talking about the property tax applied to their residential property. The terms are functionally equivalent in many tax systems, though property tax is the more formal, comprehensive term.",True,0.85,True,"{

2,"This question is asking about phantom limb pain, which is a well-documented phenomenon where individuals who have had limbs amputated continue to feel sensations, including pain, in the missing limb. The brain's neural representation of the body part remains even after the physical limb is gone. Similarly, people with paralyzed areas can sometimes experience pain in those areas despite lack of movement, as pain pathways may remain intact even when motor pathways are damaged. The sensory cortex in the brain maintains a representation of the body (called a homunculus), which can continue to generate pain signals even when the physical body part is absent or non-functional.",True,0.95,True,"{

Historically, breaking in a new car was considered important for engine longevity.

Based on the Euromillions prize structure, this combination does win a small prize in most Euromillions draws, but it's one of the smallest prize tiers."",

    ""Reasoning"": ""Lice are small parasitic insects that can infest the human scalp. They are sensitive to heat, but the effectiveness depends on the temperature and duration of exposure. Standard hair dryers typically reach temperatures of 60-80°C (140-176°F) at the nozzle, which can potentially kill lice if applied directly for a sufficient time. Research has shown that temperatures above 55°C (131°F) can be lethal to lice.

Since then, there have been no announcements about reviving the show on NBC or other networks. It's been about 8 years since cancellation, making a revival increasingly unlikely. However, I cannot be absolutely certain about future programming decisions that might revive the series on another platform."",

Both terms refer to the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis where carbon dioxide is fixed and converted into glucose. The Calvin cycle is the more precise scientific term, named after Melvin Calvin who discovered it, while 'dark reaction' is an older term that can be somewhat misleading since these reactions don't require darkness - they simply don't directly require light (unlike the light-dependent reactions).

However, there's a significant obstacle: the Darién Gap, which is a break in the Pan-American Highway between Panama and Colombia. This gap consists of about 100 kilometers of undeveloped swampland and forest with no road connection. While there are some extremely adventurous people who have crossed this with specialized vehicles, it's not possible to drive a regular car through this region. There is no road or highway that completely connects North America to South America. Therefore, it is not practically possible to drive to South America by car using conventional roads."",

While popular culture (movies, TV shows) often depicts ship captains performing marriage ceremonies, in most jurisdictions, ship captains do not automatically have the legal authority to marry couples. In some specific jurisdictions, captains may be able to perform marriages if they have been separately authorized or ordained, but this is not a universal power that comes with being a captain. In the United States, for example, the laws vary by state, and most require the person performing the ceremony to be a judge, justice of the peace, or religious official.

It is nationally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), which is one of the regional accrediting bodies recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. However, being nationally accredited doesn't automatically mean an institution is specifically accredited in every state. For New York, institutions typically need approval from the New York State Education Department to operate or offer degrees to New York residents. Without specific information about ACE's approval status with New York State, I cannot be certain. Additionally, there's a distinction between being accredited (by accrediting bodies) and being authorized to operate in a state (by state education departments)."",

They also achieved third place in the 1998 World Cup in France, defeating the Netherlands in the third-place match.

They must either be at a port of entry or already within U.S. territory to initiate an asylum claim. This is different from refugee status, which is applied for from outside the U.S. The physical presence requirement is clearly established in U.S. immigration law and has been consistently upheld in legal practice."",

It's not universally practiced or required as it is in Roman Catholicism or Eastern Orthodoxy. The Book of Common Prayer allows for it but doesn't mandate it. So while some Anglicans do make the sign of the cross, it's not a universal practice across the Church of England."",

They have not reached puberty, are still developing abstract thinking capabilities, and are legally dependent on adults for care and decision-making."",

However, there's a special rule: if the home team takes the lead in the bottom half of any extra inning, the game ends immediately (walk-off win) because the visiting team has already had their chance to bat and cannot come back. When a home team wins in this fashion, they can only win by 1 run, not 2. This is because the game ends the moment they take the lead. For example, if the score is tied 3-3 in the 10th inning, and the home team scores a run to make it 4-3, the game ends immediately. They cannot score an additional run to make it 5-3 because the game is already over. Therefore, a home team cannot win by 2 runs in extra innings.",False,0.95,True,"{

2117,"To determine if twisting someone's wrist can break it, I need to consider the anatomy and structural limitations of the wrist. The wrist is composed of eight small carpal bones, along with the radius and ulna bones of the forearm, all connected by ligaments. While the wrist is designed to have a significant range of motion, it does have mechanical limits. Applying excessive rotational force beyond these natural limits can indeed cause fractures to the carpal bones, radius, or ulna, as well as ligament tears. This is why wrist locks are used in various martial arts as control techniques, and why sports injuries from falls where the wrist is twisted can result in fractures. However, the amount of force required would typically be substantial, and would generally require leveraging the entire arm against the wrist's natural range of motion. A healthy adult wrist has considerable strength and wouldn't break from casual twisting, but with sufficient force applied in the wrong direction, breaking is certainly possible.",True,0.95,True,"{

Commodity codes are used to classify goods for import and export. In many contexts, 'commodity code' is used interchangeably with 'HS code,' especially in international trade. However, there are some regional variations. For example, in the EU, they use the Combined Nomenclature (CN) codes which are based on HS codes but with additional subdivisions. In the UK, they refer to these as 'commodity codes' which are based on the HS system but may have country-specific extensions. So while they are closely related and often based on the same system, they are not exactly the same in all contexts."",

Snake venom is a complex mixture of proteins and enzymes that can cause tissue damage, affect blood clotting, and attack the nervous system. There are two aspects to consider: natural immunity and artificially induced immunity. Humans do not naturally develop immunity to snake venom through exposure. However, immunity can be artificially induced through a process called mithridatism, where small, non-lethal doses of venom are administered over time. This is the principle behind how antivenom is produced - by injecting animals (typically horses) with small amounts of venom to produce antibodies. Additionally, some snake handlers have reportedly built up some resistance to specific venoms through repeated exposure. However, this is extremely dangerous and not medically recommended.

While shear walls do provide lateral stability to a building, their primary purpose is not necessarily to bear vertical loads (gravity loads).

The 1987 film was loosely inspired by the real-life case of John List, who murdered his family in 1971 and created a new identity. However, the movie is a highly fictionalized thriller that takes significant creative liberties with this inspiration.

This was revealed in season 5 and was a significant plot resolution for the character. However, if this question refers to a different Beckett character from another work, my answer would be incorrect."",

The world in the series is called 'The World' or sometimes 'Randland' by fans, and it has its own unique geography, history, and cosmology. There are some references in the books that suggest it might be a future Earth after some cataclysm, but this is not definitively confirmed in the main narrative."",

However, after a certain period of time (if conditions are met), many jurisdictions allow for the record to be sealed or considered spent. The exact details vary by country and jurisdiction.

The Missouri Compromise of 1820 and subsequent legislation dealt with slavery in new territories, but all New England states were firmly established as free states well before 1854.
