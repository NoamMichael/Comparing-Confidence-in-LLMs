    ""Reasoning"": ""The question is asking whether the production of ethanol requires more energy input than the energy it yields when used as a fuel. This is a complex question that has been studied extensively. The energy return on investment (EROI) for ethanol depends on many factors including feedstock (corn, sugarcane, cellulosic), production methods, and technological advancements. For corn ethanol in the US, earlier studies suggested negative energy balance, but more recent analyses with improved production efficiencies show slightly positive returns. Sugarcane ethanol in Brazil has a more favorable energy balance. The scientific consensus has evolved over time, and there are still debates, but most recent comprehensive lifecycle analyses suggest that ethanol production does yield more energy than it consumes, though the margin may be small for some production pathways."",

    ""Reasoning"": ""House tax and property tax are often used interchangeably in common language, but there can be technical differences depending on the jurisdiction. Property tax is generally a broader term that encompasses taxes on all types of real estate (residential, commercial, land) and sometimes personal property. House tax could specifically refer to taxes on residential buildings. However, in most contexts, when people refer to 'house tax,' they are indeed talking about the property tax applied to their residential property. The terms are functionally equivalent in many tax systems, though property tax is the more formal, widely-used term."",

    ""Reasoning"": ""This question is asking about phantom limb pain, which is a well-documented phenomenon where individuals who have had limbs amputated continue to feel sensations, including pain, in the missing limb. The brain's neural pathways that previously received signals from the limb remain intact and can generate pain signals even when the limb is gone. Similarly, people with paralyzed areas can sometimes experience pain in those areas despite having no motor control, as sensory pathways may remain partially functional even when motor pathways are damaged. This is known as neuropathic pain in paralyzed areas. Both phenomena are well-established in medical literature."",

However, with modern manufacturing techniques and materials, most new cars today don't require a formal break-in period.

When the electrical impulse starts in the AV junction, it typically travels both upward to the atria (retrograde) and downward to the ventricles.

So technically, while Americans can obtain or create coats of arms in various ways, they cannot receive officially sanctioned arms in the same way citizens of countries with heraldic authorities can.",True,0.85

The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war, while the President is Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. However, historically, Presidents have engaged in military actions without formal declarations of war from Congress, using authorizations for use of military force or citing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which allows the President to deploy troops for up to 60 days without congressional approval (though they must notify Congress within 48 hours). Presidents have conducted military operations in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Kosovo, Libya, and other locations without formal war declarations. So while the President cannot technically 'declare war' without Congress, they can initiate military actions that effectively constitute war-like engagements.",True,0.7

All fingers have similar venous connections, and there is no special vein connecting the ring finger directly to the heart. The circulatory system connects all parts of the body to the heart through a complex network of blood vessels, but no finger has a unique or direct connection to the heart that others don't have.",False,0.98

Theoretically, this cycle can repeat indefinitely, allowing the jellyfish to bypass death and potentially live forever, though in practice they can still be killed by predators or disease. This biological phenomenon has been well-documented in scientific literature, making this a factual statement.",True,0.98

Snake venom is a complex mixture of proteins and enzymes that can cause tissue damage, affect blood clotting, and attack the nervous system. There are two aspects to consider: natural immunity and artificially induced immunity. Humans do not naturally develop immunity to snake venom through exposure. However, immunity can be artificially induced through a process called mithridatism, where small, non-lethal doses of venom are administered over time. This is the principle behind how antivenom is produced - by injecting animals (typically horses) with small amounts of venom to produce antibodies.

}",True,True,True,"This question is about whether humans can develop immunity to snake venom. Snake venom is a complex mixture of proteins and enzymes that can cause tissue damage, affect blood clotting, and attack the nervous system. There are two aspects to consider: natural immunity and artificially induced immunity. Humans do not naturally develop immunity to snake venom through exposure. However, immunity can be artificially induced through a process called mithridatism, where small, non-lethal doses of venom are administered over time. This is the principle behind how antivenom is produced - by injecting animals (typically horses) with small amounts of venom to produce antibodies. Additionally, some snake handlers have reportedly built up some resistance to specific venoms through repeated exposure. However, this is extremely dangerous and not medically recommended. It's also important to note that immunity to one type of snake venom doesn't confer immunity to others, as venoms vary widely in composition.",True,0.9

    ""Reasoning"": ""A broken neck refers to a fracture of one or more cervical vertebrae in the neck. This can be extremely serious because the cervical spine houses the spinal cord, which is responsible for transmitting signals between the brain and the rest of the body. If the spinal cord is damaged during a neck fracture, it can lead to paralysis or death. Specifically, high cervical spine injuries (C1-C4) can affect breathing by paralyzing the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles, leading to respiratory failure and death if not immediately treated. Additionally, severe trauma to the neck can damage major blood vessels like the carotid arteries or jugular veins, causing fatal bleeding or stroke. So yes, a broken neck can definitely be fatal, though modern emergency medical care has improved survival rates for these injuries."",

    ""Reasoning"": ""Breaking waves do create turbulent water. When a wave breaks, the energy of the wave is released in a chaotic manner, causing the water to become turbulent. This turbulence is characterized by irregular fluctuations and mixing in the water. The process occurs as waves approach shallower water near shorelines, where the bottom of the wave slows down due to friction with the seabed while the top continues at the same speed, eventually causing the wave to become unstable and break. This breaking creates the white water or foam we associate with breaking waves, which is highly turbulent. This is a well-established physical phenomenon in fluid dynamics and oceanography."",

However, there are still restrictions on where weapons can be carried, and certain individuals (like felons) are still prohibited from possessing firearms. Since the question is simply asking if concealed carry is legal in Tennessee (not about specific restrictions or requirements), the answer is true - you can legally carry a concealed weapon in Tennessee if you meet the legal requirements to possess a firearm.",True,0.95

    ""Reasoning"": ""This question is about bee anatomy and stinging behavior. When a honey bee stings, its barbed stinger typically detaches from its body and remains in the victim's skin, which actually kills the bee. However, not all bee species leave their stingers behind. For example, bumblebees and many solitary bees have smooth stingers that can be withdrawn after stinging, allowing them to sting multiple times.

Some countries like Germany were particularly hard hit, which contributed to political instability.

However, a player can also win if their opponent resigns, which is common at higher levels when a player recognizes a losing position. Additionally, a player can win if their opponent's time runs out in timed games. In some tournament settings, a player can also win if their opponent makes an illegal move. Finally, in some variants or casual play, a player can win by capturing all of their opponent's pieces except the king (though this is not a standard rule in official chess)."",

    ""Reasoning"": ""In hockey, for a goal to be scored, the puck must completely cross the goal line. This is a fundamental rule in ice hockey across all major leagues including the NHL. The entire puck must cross the plane of the goal line between the goal posts and under the crossbar. If any part of the puck is still on or above the goal line, it's not considered a goal. This rule is often verified through video review in professional games when there's a question about whether the puck fully crossed the line."",
