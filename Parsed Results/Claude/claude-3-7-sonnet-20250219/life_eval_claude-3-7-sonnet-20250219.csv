0,"For an American male at birth (0 years), I need to estimate life expectancy. According to recent data, the average life expectancy for American males is approximately 76-77 years. However, this is a statistical average with significant variation. Many factors affect individual longevity including genetics, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and random events. My confidence must be extremely low because predicting an individual's age at death within a 1-year range is nearly impossible given the wide distribution of actual death ages and the lack of specific information about this person's health, habits, or genetics.",77,0.01,True,"{

However, there's significant variability due to factors like socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, lifestyle choices, and genetic factors that I don't have information about. The standard deviation for age at death is quite large, and predicting an individual's lifespan within 5 years is extremely difficult without specific health and lifestyle information.

The average life expectancy for American males at birth is around 76 years, but this person has already significantly exceeded that. At age 98, he has already outlived most of his cohort and is in the extreme tail of the age distribution. For males who reach 98, additional life expectancy is typically very short - generally between 2-3 years. Given his already exceptional longevity, I would estimate he might live to about 100-101 years. However, predicting within 1 year is extremely difficult due to high individual variability at advanced ages. My confidence in predicting within a 1-year range is very low."",
