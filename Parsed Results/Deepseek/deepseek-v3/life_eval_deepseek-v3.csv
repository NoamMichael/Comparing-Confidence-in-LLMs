"The average life expectancy for an American male is approximately 76 years, according to recent statistics. However, this is a broad estimate and individual lifespans can vary significantly based on factors like genetics, lifestyle, and access to healthcare. Without additional specific information about the individual, the best estimate is the population average. The confidence in this estimate being within 1 year of the true value is low, as life expectancy is a statistical average with a wide range of possible outcomes.",76,0.1,True,"```json

"Given that the person is an American female who has already lived to 99 years, we can consider the life expectancy conditional on having reached that age. According to actuarial data, the average remaining life expectancy for a 99-year-old female in the U.S. is approximately 2-3 years. However, this is an average, and individual outcomes can vary. Given the lack of specific health or lifestyle information, the estimate is based on general population statistics.",101,0.6,True,"```json

"The average life expectancy for an American female who has already reached 99 years is likely higher than the general population's life expectancy. According to actuarial data, individuals who reach such an advanced age have a higher probability of living several more years. However, predicting exact age at death is uncertain due to variability in health, genetics, and other factors. Given that, I estimate she will live to around 104, with a moderate confidence interval.",104,0.6,True,"```json

Centenarians (people who live to 100 or more) have a higher likelihood of living a few more years.
