    ""Reasoning"": ""The energy balance of ethanol production depends on the feedstock and production process. Corn-based ethanol, which is common in the United States, has been criticized for having a low energy return on investment (EROI), meaning it can take nearly as much energy to produce as it provides. However, technological improvements and the use of byproducts can improve this balance. Cellulosic ethanol, made from non-food plant materials, generally has a better energy balance. Overall, while some forms of ethanol production may have a low or negative energy balance, others can be more efficient. Therefore, the statement is not universally true."",
