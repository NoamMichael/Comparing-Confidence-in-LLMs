Cellulosic and sugar-cane ethanol are higher still.

Now, if the aggregate score is tied after both legs, the match goes directly to extra time and, if necessary, penalties—away goals no longer provide any advantage."",

    ""Reasoning"": ""During the 1991 Gulf War, retreating Iraqi forces set hundreds of Kuwaiti oil wells on fire. The smoke plumes injected soot and un-burned hydrocarbon particles into the atmosphere. When moisture condensed, some rain carried these particles back to the ground as a sooty, oily residue often called “black rain.” However, it was not literal showers of liquid crude oil; it was normal rainwater contaminated with soot and aerosolized hydrocarbons. Therefore the claim that it ‘rained oil’ in the Gulf War—taken to mean actual crude oil falling like rain—is inaccurate."",

    ""Reasoning"": ""In most culinary contexts—especially in the United States—cornstarch is the purified starch extracted from the endosperm of the corn kernel, used mainly as a thickening agent. Corn flour is the whole-kernel corn ground to a fine powder, so it still contains protein, fiber, and fat and behaves more like other flours. Therefore they are not the same product (though in some countries, such as the U.K. or Australia, the term “cornflour” is used for what Americans call cornstarch). Because the question likely intends the U.S. distinction, the correct answer is that they are different."",
