Because we know nothing about his individual health, lifestyle, or socioeconomic status, the population average (≈80) is the best single-point estimate. The spread of male deaths around that mean is wide (a standard deviation of roughly 10 years), so the chance that the true age at death falls within ±20 years (60–100) is high but not certain, since early deaths from accidents, disease, or very long lifespans beyond 100 are possible, though rare.

Childhood mortality has already been passed, so conditional life expectancy is a bit higher than the 81-year life expectancy at birth for American females.  Most deaths for women who reach 13 occur between the mid-60s and late-90s; fewer than 5 % die before 64 and fewer than 2 % live past 104.  Therefore a prediction of 84 is close to the actuarial mean and has a high chance of lying within ±20 years of the actual age at death (64–104), though individual variation is large.",84,0.9
