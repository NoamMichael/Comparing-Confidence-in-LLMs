"Only one trade is made and it must match an allowed pattern.  In C, Southco trades its class-2 Lynch Building to RealProp for RealProp’s two class-3 houses (Yates and Zimmer).  This is exactly the permitted ‘one class-2 for two class-3’ trade, and no other buildings move.

To finish with only class-2 buildings it must: (i) turn the class-1 building into two class-2’s (rule: 1 class-1 ↔ 2 class-2); only Trustcorp initially has two class-2’s, so the class-1 must be traded to Trustcorp.  (ii) trade its two class-3’s for a class-2 (rule: 1 class-2 ↔ 2 class-3), which again can be done with Trustcorp.

"Trustcorp begins with three class-2 buildings and must end with none. Only two class-3 buildings exist (Yates and Zimmer). To eliminate an odd total of class-2s, Trustcorp must (1) trade two class-2s for a class-1 (type-2 trade) and (2) trade its remaining class-2 for two class-3s (type-3 trade). The type-3 trade gives Trustcorp both existing class-3 buildings, Yates and Zimmer, because no other class-3s exist. After this trade, Trustcorp cannot give Zimmer away without regaining a class-2, so Zimmer must be in its final holdings. No other option is forced.",E,0.07,0.03,0.05,0.1,0.75,True,"{

"Totals of each class (2 class-1, 4 class-2, 2 class-3) never change. To get Yates House (class-3), Trustcorp must receive it from RealProp. The only legal way for a company without any class-3 buildings to receive a class-3 is the 1 class-2 → 2 class-3 trade, which necessarily gives both Yates and Zimmer to Trustcorp. Once Trustcorp holds both class-3 buildings, there is no rule that lets it dispose of just one of them (it can only trade a single class-3 for another class-3, and no one else has one).
