""Reasoning"": ""To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the possible trades that can be made. Since each trade must be of one of the three kinds, we can examine each option to see if it satisfies the conditions. Option A is possible if RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2) is not involved in the trade, which is not allowed. Option B is possible if RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the King Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2), which is allowed. Option C is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Lynch Building (class 2) as it is not a valid trade. Option D is possible if RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Meyer Building (class 2) and the Yates House (class 3), which is allowed.

""Reasoning"": ""To solve this problem, we need to analyze the possible trades that can occur. If RealProp owns only class 2 buildings after some trades, it means they must have traded away their class 1 and class 3 buildings. The only way they can get rid of their class 1 building (Garza Tower) is by trading it for two class 2 buildings. Since Trustcorp only owns class 2 buildings, it's possible that they traded two of their class 2 buildings to RealProp. However, this would mean that Trustcorp now has only one class 2 building left, which is not enough to fulfill the condition that RealProp owns only class 2 buildings. Therefore, Trustcorp must have acquired a class 1 building from either RealProp or Southco. The only class 1 building that Southco owns is the Flores Tower, so if Trustcorp acquired a class 1 building, it must be the Flores Tower. However, this is not among the answer choices.
