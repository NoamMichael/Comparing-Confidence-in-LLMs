123,123,,,,,,False,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is not directly stated, but it can be inferred from the information provided. The passage states that in 1960, 12 of the top 20 countries with the largest average city size were high-income countries, but by 2010, 14 of the top 20 were in the developing world. It also mentions that the median city in the developing world nearly quadrupled between 1960 and 2010, expanding from 220,000 to 845,000 people.

Given this information, it is likely that the median city population size in developing countries surpassed that of high-income countries sometime between 1960 and 2010. The most plausible range is between 1980 and 1995, as this allows for a gradual increase in population size over several decades.

In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially.

We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches.
