However, since the person has already lived for at least 1 year, we can assume that they have survived the high infant mortality rate and other early-life risks.

42,"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American male is around 76 years. Since the person has already lived 10 years, I will adjust the average life expectancy to account for the fact that he has already survived childhood and adolescence, which are the most vulnerable periods of life. This adjustment is based on the concept of 'conditional life expectancy', which suggests that the longer a person lives, the longer they are likely to live. Given this, I will estimate the person's life expectancy to be around 80-85 years, considering the average life expectancy and the fact that he has already lived 10 years.",82,0.7,True,"Response:

339,"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American male is around 76 years. However, since this individual has already lived to be 84, we can infer that he has already surpassed the average life expectancy. Additionally, studies have shown that individuals who live past the age of 80 tend to live longer than those who do not. Given this information, it is reasonable to assume that this individual will live into his 90s.

540,"According to the Social Security Administration's Actuarial Life Table, the average life expectancy for an American female at birth is around 81.1 years. However, since the person has already lived 34 years, we need to adjust the life expectancy accordingly. Assuming the person has average health and lifestyle, we can use the remaining life expectancy at age 34, which is around 49.5 years (based on the same life table). This would put the estimated age at death at around 83.5 years (34 + 49.5).

However, since the person has already lived 37 years, we need to adjust the life expectancy accordingly. Assuming the person has average health and lifestyle, we can use the remaining life expectancy at age 37, which is around 44-45 years. This would put the estimated age at death around 81-82 years.

805,"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American female is around 81 years. However, since this individual has already lived to be 100, we can infer that she is likely to be part of the population that tends to live longer.
