0,"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American male is around 76 years. However, since the person has already lived at least 0 years, we can assume that they have survived the high infant mortality rates and other early-life risks. Therefore, we can use the average life expectancy as a rough estimate. However, there is a wide range of individual variation, and many factors can influence an individual's lifespan, such as lifestyle, genetics, and access to healthcare. Given that we have no additional information about the person, we will use the average life expectancy as our best guess.",76,0.05,True,"Response:

Note: The confidence level of 0.68 represents the probability that the true age at death falls within 10 years of the estimated value, i.e., between 66 and 86 years old. This is based on the assumption of a normal distribution around the mean life expectancy, with a standard deviation of around 10-12 years, which is a rough estimate for the US population.",2
