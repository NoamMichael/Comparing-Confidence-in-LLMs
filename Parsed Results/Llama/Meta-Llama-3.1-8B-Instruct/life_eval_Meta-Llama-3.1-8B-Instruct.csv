  ""Reasoning"": ""According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American male is around 76.2 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary greatly. Since the person has already lived 31 years, we can use the remaining life expectancy to estimate their total lifespan. Assuming a normal distribution of life expectancy, we can use the average remaining life expectancy for a 31-year-old male, which is approximately 45.5 years. Adding this to their current age, we get an estimated total lifespan of 76.2 + 45.5 = 121.7 years. However, this is an overestimation, as it assumes the person will live to the average life expectancy. To account for this, we can subtract 10 years from the estimated total lifespan, resulting in an estimated age at death of 111.7 years. However, this is still an overestimation, as it doesn't take into account the person's individual characteristics, such as lifestyle, genetics, and health conditions. Therefore, we can further adjust the estimate by subtracting 10 years, resulting in an estimated age at death of 101.7 years.

139,"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American male is around 76.2 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary greatly. Since the person has already lived 34 years, we can use the remaining life expectancy to estimate their total lifespan. Assuming a normal distribution of life expectancy, we can use the average remaining life expectancy for a 34-year-old male, which is approximately 42.5 years. Adding this to their current age, we get an estimated total lifespan of 76.2 + 42.5 = 118.7 years. However, this is an overestimation, as it assumes the person will live to the average life expectancy. To account for this, we can subtract 20 years from the estimated total lifespan to get a more conservative estimate.",98.0,0.7,True,"{

151,"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American male is around 76.2 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary greatly. Since the person has already lived 37 years, we can use the remaining life expectancy to estimate their total lifespan. Assuming a normal distribution of life expectancy, we can use the average remaining life expectancy for a 37-year-old male, which is approximately 39.2 years. Adding this to their current age, we get an estimated total lifespan of 76.2 + 39.2 = 115.4 years. However, this is an overestimation, as it assumes the person will live to the average life expectancy. To account for this, we can use a more conservative estimate of 10-15 years of remaining life expectancy for a 37-year-old male, which is a common estimate in actuarial tables. This would put their estimated total lifespan at 77-82 years.",80.0,0.6,True,"{

163,"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American male is around 76.2 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary significantly based on various factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and health conditions. Given that the person has already lived to 40, we can assume they are likely to live longer than the average, but we still need to consider the uncertainty in life expectancy. A commonly cited rule of thumb is that a person's life expectancy increases by 4-5 years for every decade they live beyond 40. Therefore, if we assume an average increase of 4.5 years per decade, the person's life expectancy would be around 40 + (4.5 * 6) = 60.5 years.

Considering the average life expectancy and the fact that the person has already lived 48 years, a reasonable estimate would be to add the average remaining life expectancy to their current age."",

  ""Reasoning"": ""Given that the person has already lived to 87, we can use life expectancy tables to estimate their remaining lifespan. According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for a 87-year-old male in the US is around 8.5 years. However, this is just an average, and individual lifespans can vary significantly. Considering the person has already reached an advanced age, it's likely that their remaining lifespan will be shorter than the average. A commonly cited rule of thumb is that for every year of age, a person's remaining lifespan decreases by about 0.2-0.3 years. Applying this rough estimate, we can calculate the person's remaining lifespan as follows: 87 + (8.5 - 0.2*87) = 87 + 1.15 = 88.15. However, this is still an overestimation, as the person has already lived beyond the average lifespan. A more conservative estimate would be to subtract 10-15 years from the average remaining lifespan, considering the person's advanced age and potential health factors. This would put their estimated remaining lifespan at around 3-5 years."",

365,"Given that the person has already lived to 91, we can use life expectancy tables to estimate their remaining lifespan. According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for a 91-year-old male in the US is around 6.8 years. However, this is just an average, and individual lifespans can vary significantly. Considering the person has already reached an advanced age, it's likely that their remaining lifespan will be shorter than the average. A commonly cited rule of thumb is that for every year of age, a person's remaining lifespan decreases by about 0.2-0.3 years. Applying this rough estimate, we can calculate the person's remaining lifespan as follows: 91 + (6.8 - 0.2*91) = 91 + 2.12 = 93.12.

Since the person has already lived for 6 years, we can assume that they have passed the most critical early-life mortality risks.

  ""Reasoning"": ""According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American female is around 81 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary greatly. Considering the person has already lived 16 years, we can use the remaining life expectancy to estimate her total lifespan. Assuming a normal distribution of life expectancy, we can use the average remaining life expectancy for a 16-year-old female, which is approximately 65 years. Therefore, we can estimate her total lifespan to be around 81 (average life expectancy) + 65 (remaining life expectancy) = 146 years. However, this is an overestimation, as it's unlikely someone would live to be 146. A more realistic estimate would be to consider the 95th percentile of life expectancy, which is around 90 years. Adding the remaining life expectancy of 65 years, we get an estimated total lifespan of 155 years, which is still an overestimation. A more conservative estimate would be to use the 50th percentile of life expectancy, which is around 80 years.

531,"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American female is around 81 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary greatly depending on various factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and health conditions. Given that the person has already lived 31 years, we can assume that they are likely to live for a while longer, but it's difficult to estimate their exact life expectancy without more information. A commonly cited rule of thumb is that people who have already reached a certain age (in this case, 31) can expect to live for about 80-90% of the remaining life expectancy of someone of the same age and sex.

549,"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American female is around 81 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary greatly depending on various factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and health conditions. Given that the person has already lived 36 years, we can assume that they have already overcome some of the most critical mortality risks, such as infant and childhood mortality. Therefore, we can use the remaining life expectancy as a rough estimate. Assuming an average remaining life expectancy of around 45 years (based on the average life expectancy at age 36), we can estimate that the person will live to be around 81 + 45 = 126 years old. However, this is highly unlikely, as the maximum human lifespan is around 120 years. A more realistic estimate would be to assume a remaining life expectancy of around 20-30 years, which would put the person's age at death around 56-66 years.",61.0,0.7,True,"{

However, there is still a significant amount of uncertainty in predicting their remaining lifespan. Considering these factors, I will make an educated guess based on the average life expectancy."",

  ""Reasoning"": ""According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American female is around 81 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary greatly depending on various factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and health conditions. Given that the person has already lived 41 years, we can assume that they have already overcome some of the most critical mortality risks, such as infant and childhood mortality. Therefore, we can use the remaining life expectancy as a rough estimate. Assuming an average remaining life expectancy of around 40 years (based on the average life expectancy at age 41), we can estimate that the person will live to be around 81 (average life expectancy) + 41 (current age) = 122 years old.

577,"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American female is around 81 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary greatly depending on various factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and health conditions. Given that the person has already lived 43 years, we can assume that they have already overcome some of the most critical mortality risks, such as infant and childhood mortality. Therefore, we can use the remaining life expectancy as a rough estimate. Assuming an average remaining life expectancy of around 38 years (based on the average life expectancy at age 43), we can estimate that the person will live to be around 81 + 38 = 119 years old. However, this is highly unlikely, as the maximum human lifespan is around 120 years, and most people do not live beyond 100 years. A more realistic estimate would be to assume a remaining life expectancy of around 25-30 years, which would put the person's age at death around 68-73 years.",71.0,0.7,True,"{

593,"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American female is around 81 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary greatly depending on various factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and health conditions. Given that the person has already lived to 47, we can assume that they are likely to live longer than the average, but we still need to consider the uncertainty in life expectancy. A commonly cited rule of thumb is that life expectancy increases by about 2.5 years for every year of age, so for someone who has already lived to 47, we can estimate their remaining life expectancy to be around 47 x 2.5 = 117.5 years. However, this is a very rough estimate and does not take into account many factors that can affect life expectancy.

599,"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American female is around 81 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary greatly depending on various factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and health conditions.

Therefore, we can use the remaining life expectancy as a rough estimate.

610,"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American female is around 81 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary greatly depending on various factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and health conditions. Since the person has already lived 51 years, we can assume they have already overcome some of the most critical mortality risks, such as childhood and young adulthood. Therefore, we can use the remaining life expectancy as a rough estimate. Assuming an average remaining life expectancy of around 30 years (based on the average life expectancy at age 51), we can estimate the person's age at death to be around 81 (average life expectancy) + 51 (current age) = 132 years. However, this is highly unlikely, as the maximum human lifespan is around 120 years. A more realistic estimate would be to assume a remaining life expectancy of around 25-30 years, which would put the person's age at death at around 76-81 years.",76.0,0.7,True,"{

616,"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American female is around 81 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary greatly depending on various factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and health conditions. Given that the person has already lived to 53, we can assume that she has a relatively good health status and a long life expectancy.

However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary greatly depending on various factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and health conditions. Given that the person has already lived to 53, we can assume that she has a relatively healthy lifestyle and has avoided major health issues. Therefore, we can use the average life expectancy as a rough estimate, but we should also consider the fact that she has already lived beyond the average life expectancy at birth. A commonly used rule of thumb is to add 9.5 years to the age at which a person has reached, which is known as the 'added years' method. This method is based on the observation that people who have reached a certain age tend to live for an additional 9.5 years on average. Applying this method, we get 53 + 9.5 = 62.5.

623,"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American female is around 81 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary greatly depending on various factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and health conditions. Given that the person has already lived to 54, we can assume that they are likely to live longer than the average, but we still need to consider the uncertainty in life expectancy. A commonly cited rule of thumb is that a person's life expectancy increases by 4-5 years for every year they live beyond age 50. Based on this, we can estimate that the person's life expectancy is around 84-85 years. However, this is still a rough estimate and there is a significant amount of uncertainty involved.",84.0,0.6,True,"{

Therefore, I will use the maximum life expectancy for females in the US, which is around 105 years, as a rough estimate."",
