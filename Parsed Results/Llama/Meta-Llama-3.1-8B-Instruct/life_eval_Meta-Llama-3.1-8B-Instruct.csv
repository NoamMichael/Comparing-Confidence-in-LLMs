"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American male at birth is approximately 76.2 years. However, this number can vary depending on various factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and health conditions. Since the person has already lived at least 0 years, we can assume they have survived the most critical early years of life. Therefore, we can use the average life expectancy as a rough estimate. However, considering the person has already lived at least 0 years, we should add a small buffer to account for the fact that they have already overcome some of the most significant mortality risks.",76.0,0.7,True,"{

"According to the Social Security Administration, the average life expectancy for an American male is around 76.2 years. However, this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary greatly depending on various factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and health conditions. Since the person has already lived 13 years, we can assume they are likely to live a bit longer than the average, but not significantly so. A common rule of thumb is to add 5-10 years to the average life expectancy for a rough estimate of life expectancy for someone who has already lived to a certain age. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for this person's life expectancy would be around 81-86 years.",83.0,0.7,True,"{

Considering the person has already lived 17 years, we can use the remaining life expectancy to estimate her total lifespan.

Given that the person has already lived to 97, we can assume she is above average in terms of health and longevity. Considering the maximum human lifespan is around 122 years (as of my knowledge cutoff), and taking into account the fact that she has already lived to 97, a reasonable estimate for her remaining lifespan would be around 5-10 years, considering the average increase in lifespan after 90 is relatively small.
