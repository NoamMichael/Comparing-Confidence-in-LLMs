Dizygotic twins are formed when two separate eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, which is possible if a woman releases multiple eggs during ovulation and is fertilized by different men. Monozygotic twins, on the other hand, are formed when a single fertilized egg splits and develops into two separate embryos.

An SUV, on the other hand, is a more rugged and off-road-capable vehicle with a higher ground clearance and a more boxy design. While some crossovers may have SUV-like features, not all SUVs are crossovers. Therefore, they are not the same thing."",

  ""Reasoning"": ""In professional baseball, a tie game can occur if the score is tied after the scheduled number of innings, and the game is not completed due to weather or other circumstances. This has happened several times in the history of baseball, with the most notable example being the 1912 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Giants, which was tied 1-1 after 10 innings in Game 6, but was not completed due to darkness. Additionally, there have been several instances of tie games in regular season games, such as in 2005 when the Chicago Cubs and the Milwaukee Brewers played a 23-inning game that ended in a 0-0 tie."",

Joint tenancy is a form of co-ownership where two or more individuals hold a property together, with equal rights and interests. Joint tenancy with right of survivorship, on the other hand, is a type of joint tenancy where the surviving co-owner automatically inherits the entire property upon the death of the other co-owner, without the need for probate. This means that the surviving co-owner receives the property without having to go through the court process of probate, which can be time-consuming and costly."",

  ""Reasoning"": ""In the context of sports, particularly in the league playoffs, an away goal is a goal scored by a visiting team in a two-legged tie. It is a common rule in many sports leagues, including the UEFA Champions League and the FIFA World Cup, that away goals count in the event of a tie after the two legs. However, the specific rules can vary depending on the league or tournament. In the context of the question, it is likely referring to a league with a playoff format, where teams compete in a series of matches to determine the champion. In this case, away goals are often used as a tiebreaker in the event of a tie after the regular season or a round-robin stage.
