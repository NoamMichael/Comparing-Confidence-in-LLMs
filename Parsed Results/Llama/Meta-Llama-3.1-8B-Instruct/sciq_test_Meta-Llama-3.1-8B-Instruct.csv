However, the question states that wavelengths from 400-700 nm represent the visible light, which is the majority of the spectrum. Therefore, the correct answer is the option that represents a smaller portion of the spectrum. Ultraviolet light has a shorter wavelength and is not visible to the human eye, making it a smaller portion of the spectrum."",
