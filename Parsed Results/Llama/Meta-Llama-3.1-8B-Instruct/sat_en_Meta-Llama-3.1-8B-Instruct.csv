{
""Reasoning"": ""The passage discusses the 'missing mantle problem' in the asteroid belt, where the majority of rocky material from differentiated asteroids is missing. The text suggests that iron fragments from these asteroids are more likely to survive in the asteroid belt due to their strength and resistance to disruption. The passage also proposes that the parent bodies of iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, where collisions were more frequent, and that only the stronger iron objects survived. This explanation is supported by the fact that the asteroid belt contains a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron. The table is not explicitly mentioned in the passage, but based on the context, it is likely that the table provides data on the composition of asteroids in the asteroid belt. Given the discussion of iron and rocky fragments, the table likely shows that iron fragments are more common in the asteroid belt than rocky fragments. Therefore, the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt is likely in asteroids that are high in iron content, which is not explicitly listed as an option.

,,,,,,False,"Here is the analysis:

The passage discusses the ""missing mantle problem"" in the asteroid belt, where the rocky material from the mantles of iron meteorite parent bodies is scarce. The model proposed by some astronomers suggests that iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, where collisions were more frequent, and were disrupted by violent collisions, scattering iron and rocky fragments into the asteroid belt. The iron fragments survived longer due to their strength, while the rocky fragments were ground down to dust. The passage does not provide direct information about type C asteroids, but it does discuss the survival of iron and rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.

Reasoning: The passage does not provide specific information about type C asteroids, but it does discuss the survival of iron and rocky fragments in the asteroid belt. The model proposed by some astronomers suggests that iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun and were disrupted by collisions, scattering iron and rocky fragments into the asteroid belt. However, this model does not provide a clear connection to type C asteroids.

,,,,,,False,"There is no table mentioned in the passage. The passage discusses the transformation of authority in the news media and the changing expectations of the audience, but it does not provide any data or statistics about trust in the news media over time.

However, based on the context, it seems that the passage is discussing the shift from a traditional, expert-driven model of news production to a more democratic and participatory model. The passage mentions the rise of online news and the increasing demand for raw, unfiltered news, which suggests that people's trust in the news media may have decreased over time.

Given the options, I would guess that the year when people were most trusting of the news media is likely to be one of the earlier options, as the passage suggests that trust in the news media has decreased over time.

Here is my response:
