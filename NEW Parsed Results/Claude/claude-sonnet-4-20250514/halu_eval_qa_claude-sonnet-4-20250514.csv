The context states that ""He was ranked 359th in the 'Sunday Times Rich List 2009' with an estimated wealth of £157 million"" and mentions that something ""was based on the novel 'The Carry-Cot' by Alexander Thynn."" While the question asks about the film ""Blue Blood"" specifically, the context doesn't explicitly mention this film title. However, it's reasonable to infer that the wealth figure refers to Alexander Thynn, the author of the novel mentioned. My confidence is 0.7 because while the wealth figure is clearly stated, there's some ambiguity about whether this directly answers the question about ""Blue Blood"" since that film title isn't explicitly mentioned in the context.",5272_r

- Luculia is described as being ""currently found from the Himalayas to southern China""
- There's a mention of ""three species native to California and Baja California"" but this appears to be referring to a different plant (likely Bloomeria based on the question)

From the geographical ranges I can identify:
- Luculia: Himalayas to southern China (a vast area across Asia)
- Bloomeria (inferred): California and Baja California (a much smaller regional area)

The range from the Himalayas to southern China covers multiple countries and a much larger geographical area than California and Baja California.

2. The context mentions ""The former record was equalled by the 2004 Patriots""
3. The 2004 New England Patriots season is specifically mentioned

Super Bowl XXXIX was played following the 2004 NFL season, and the New England Patriots won that Super Bowl. The context indicates that the 2004 Patriots equaled a record that was previously set, and given that the 1978 Miami Dolphins are specifically mentioned in the same context, this suggests the Patriots equaled a record held by the 1978 Miami Dolphins.

The context states that ""Real Madrid won 5–3 on aggregate"" and mentions the 1996-97 La Liga season (66th since establishment) that ran from August 31, 1996 to June 23, 1997. However, there's some confusion in the question as it mentions matches on August 20 and 23, 1997, which would be after the La Liga season ended on June 23, 1997. Despite this temporal inconsistency, the context clearly indicates Real Madrid won an aggregate match, so I'm reasonably confident this is the answer being sought, though the date discrepancy reduces my confidence somewhat.",5537_r
713,0.9,True,"Looking at the context provided, I can see that:

1. Real Madrid won 5-3 on aggregate in some match
2. The 1996-97 La Liga season (66th since establishment) ran from August 31, 1996 to June 23, 1997

However, there's a logical inconsistency in the question. The question asks about a match played on August 20 and 23, 1997, but the 1996-97 La Liga season ended on June 23, 1997. A match in August 1997 would be part of the following season (1997-98), not the 66th season mentioned.

The context doesn't provide information about who won a specific two-leg match on those August 1997 dates. While Real Madrid is mentioned as winning 5-3 on aggregate, there's no indication this refers to the specific August 1997 match in question.

{
    ""Answer"": ""The context does not provide sufficient information to determine which team won the two-leg Spanish football match played on August 20 and 23, 1997.

The context describes ""Hancock and Joan"" as a 2008 biographical television film about the affair between Tony Hancock and Joan Le Mesurier. The mention of ""Silk"" (the BBC legal drama) appears to be describing later work by an actress (likely the one who played Joan Le Mesurier in the film), not something that would be referenced within the biographical film itself.

The context states that Broken Bells is composed of two members: Brian Burton (Danger Mouse) and James Mercer. However, for Navarone, the context only mentions it's a Dutch alternative rock band formed in 2008, without specifying the exact number of members. Since most rock bands typically have more than two members, and no information suggests Navarone is also a duo, it's reasonable to assume Navarone likely has more members than Broken Bells' two members. However, my confidence is moderate (0.7) because the exact number of Navarone members isn't explicitly stated in the context.",5234_r

The context does provide Claudio Pizarro's full name as ""Claudio Miguel Pizarro Bosio,"" which shows his middle names are ""Miguel"" and potentially ""Pizarro"" (though ""Pizarro"" appears to be his paternal surname in the Hispanic naming convention, with ""Bosio"" being his maternal surname).

However, there's ambiguity in the question since it's unclear if Pizarro was specifically the decisive player in the Werder Bremen victory, as the context only mentions he scored in the DFB-Pokal final against Eintracht Frankfurt.

However, the context then mentions that ""He received over 80 awards as an animation director and animator, and also developed the character of Goofy."" The pronoun ""He"" is ambiguous - it could refer to either animator mentioned, or potentially to someone else mentioned earlier in the context.

Given the grammatical structure and typical writing conventions, the pronoun ""He"" most likely refers to the last person specifically mentioned in their professional capacity, but the ambiguity makes it impossible to definitively determine from this context alone whether Art Babbitt received over 80 awards or if this refers to someone else.

The context states that since 1987, the US Open has been ""chronologically the fourth and final tennis major comprising the Grand Slam each year"" and that ""the other three, in chronological order, are the Australian Open, the French Open and Wimbledon.""

This means Wimbledon is the tennis major that comes immediately before the US Open in the yearly calendar. The context then mentions that the first tournament (referring to one of these majors) was ""first held in 1905.""

However, there's some ambiguity in the context about which tournament the ""1905"" date refers to. The sentence structure suggests it might be referring to the Australian Open (as the first mentioned), but historically, Wimbledon was first held in 1877, not 1905.

Given the context provided and the specific wording, the answer appears to be 1905, though I have some uncertainty due to the ambiguous phrasing in the source material.

Based on the context provided, Aldous Huxley had a broader scope of profession.

The context indicates that Sansha administers several island groups including the Spratly Islands, Paracel Islands, and other maritime features in the South China Sea, which would contain numerous individual islands.
